Symptoms

Early on, gallbladder and bile duct cancers may cause no symptoms. Nor can they be seen or felt during a routine physical exam. Rather, many of them are found when the gallbladder is removed as a treatment for gallstones. There are no screening tests for these cancers.

When symptoms occur, they can include

jaundice
abdominal pain or swelling



nausea and/or vomiting
lack of appetite
losing weight for no reason
itching
fever that doesn't go away.

Jaundice is the most common symptom of bile duct cancer, and nearly half of all people with gallbladder cancer have jaundice when they are diagnosed. Jaundice makes the skin and the whites of the eyes look yellow. This happens when the liver cannot get rid of bile. Levels of bilirubin (a dark yellow chemical in bile) then rise in the bloodstream.

Although many people with gallbladder and bile duct cancers have jaundice, the most common causes of jaundice are hepatitis and cirrhosis, not cancer. Having a gallstone lodged in the bile duct can also cause jaundice; it can prevent bile from flowing into the small intestine. This is a noncancerous condition.
