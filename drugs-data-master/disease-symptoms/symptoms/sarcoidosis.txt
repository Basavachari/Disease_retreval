Symptoms

Some people with sarcoidosis do not have any symptoms. Others simply feel tired and weak. Still others have nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, poor appetite, night sweats, joint pain or aching muscles.

Symptoms vary widely because the disease affects different parts of the body in different people. Among those who see their doctors for more specific symptoms, more than 90% have problems involving the lungs. The first signs are usually a dry cough and shortness of breath. Later, there may also be wheezing, chest pain and, rarely, a cough that brings up bloody mucus. Rarely, in severe cases, lung function may become so poor that you cannot do even simple, routine tasks of daily life.

Other symptoms of sarcoidosis are less common than lung symptoms. They can include:

Skin symptoms — Sarcoidosis can appear as a collection of tender, red bumps called erythema nodosum. It also can appear as a scaly, purplish discoloration on the nose, cheeks and ears called lupus pernio. Less often, sarcoidosis causes cysts, pimples or disfiguring overgrowths of skin. In many cases, the disfiguring overgrowths develop in areas of scars or tattoos.
Eye symptoms — These include red eyes, eye pain and sensitivity to light due to a condition called uveitis.
Heart symptoms — These include irregular heartbeat and heart failure.
Other symptoms — A person may have paralyzed facial muscles, seizures, psychiatric symptoms, swollen salivary glands or bone pain.
