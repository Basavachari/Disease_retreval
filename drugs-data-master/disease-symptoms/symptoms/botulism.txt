Symptoms

All of the symptoms of botulism are the result of nerve paralysis during exposure to the toxin. Symptoms usually begin within one to two days after eating contaminated food. Symptoms of infant botulism and wound botulism also appear suddenly.

The earliest symptoms involve the eyes and face, because nerves controlling their function are affected most quickly by the botulism toxin. Early or mild symptoms, which may go away on their own, include:

Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (not usually present in wound botulism)
Double vision, blurred vision (especially when viewing close objects) or drooping eyelids
Dryness of the mouth

More severe cases can cause these additional symptoms:

Slurred or garbled speech
Difficulty swallowing
Muscle weakness in arms or legs; general fatigue
Difficulty breathing, sometimes severe
In infants, usually constipation at first; also lethargy and a "floppy" neck, arms and legs, demonstrating weak muscles; difficulty feeding; failure to cry well
