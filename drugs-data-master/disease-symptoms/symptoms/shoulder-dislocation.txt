Symptoms

Symptoms of a dislocated shoulder include:

Severe shoulder pain
Limited motion of the shoulder
A distortion in the contour of the shoulder — In an anterior dislocation, the side silhouette of the shoulder has an abnormal squared-off appearance instead of its typical sloping, rounded contour. In a posterior dislocation, the front of the shoulder may look abnormally flat.
A hard knob under the skin near the shoulder — This knob is the top of the humerus that has popped out of its socket.
Shoulder bruising or abrasions if an impact has caused your injury
