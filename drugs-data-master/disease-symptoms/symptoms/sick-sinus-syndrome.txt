Symptoms

Most of the time, sick sinus syndrome doesn't cause any symptoms. When it does cause symptoms, they are very vague and can be attributed to many other disorders. Therefore, it is very hard to diagnose sick sinus syndrome just on the basis of symptoms.

Symptoms may include:

fatigue
decreased exercise tolerance
dizziness or lightheadedness
fainting or near-fainting
the sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations)
shortness of breath

Over the long term, sick sinus syndrome can increase your risk for stroke and heart failure. Injuries can occur if you fall during a fainting episode.
