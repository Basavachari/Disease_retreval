Symptoms

A dislocated lens often causes blurred vision. The amount of blurring depends on the extent of the detachment and dislocation. A partially detached lens may not cause any symptoms. When the ligaments that support the lens are damaged, the iris (the circular structure that gives the eye its color) also may lose support and may quiver.
