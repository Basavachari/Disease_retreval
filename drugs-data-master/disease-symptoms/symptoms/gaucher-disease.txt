Symptoms

Newborn babies with GD do not show any symptoms. Depending on the type of GD, symptoms develop at different times. In GD1, symptoms may not become apparent until a person is a young adult; but some patients get liver and spleen enlargement in childhood (sometimes as young as age 1 or 2). In most people, GD1 causes a large liver and spleen, anemia, low platelets, and thinning and weakening of bones. Anemia can cause fatigue, while low platelets can lead to easy bruising and nosebleeds.

GD2 and GD3 cause neurological symptoms. In the past, these names were used to separate patients into categories of more severe (GD2) and less severe (GD3). Typically, GD2 has meant that symptoms start as early as 3 months old. In addition to the typical GD symptoms, people with GD2 often have neurological problems such as severe developmental delays, muscle stiffness, and possibly seizures.

GD3 typically starts causing symptoms in childhood or adolescence. It can cause enlarged liver and spleen, but these symptoms don't show up consistently in all patients. It also causes neurological problems such as confusion or dementia, worsening mental function, abnormal eye movements, and muscle weakness. The symptoms do not get worse as quickly as they do in people with GD2. GD2 and GD3 are similar because they both involve neurological symptoms, while GD1 does not.

Cardiovascular GD is another type that mainly affects the heart. These patients may also get an enlarged spleen, cloudy corneas, and abnormal eye movements.
