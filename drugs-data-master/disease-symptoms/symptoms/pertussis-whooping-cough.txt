Symptoms

On average, symptoms begin about 7 to 10 days after the pertussis bacteria enter your body. Initial symptoms usually resemble the common cold. Other symptoms may include:

Low-grade fever 
Sneezing 
Runny nose 
Diarrhea 
Vomiting 
Thick, clear discharge from the nose 
Episodes of rapid coughing followed by a high-pitched whooping sound 
Frequent coughing episodes at night 
Recurring coughing episodes for one to two months


Infants under 6 months of age, adolescents and adults may have a cough that lasts many weeks without the characteristic whooping sound. If you have a cough that lasts more than a week without improvement, contact your doctor.
