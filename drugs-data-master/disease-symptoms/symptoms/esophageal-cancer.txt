Symptoms

At first, esophageal cancer may not cause any symptoms. But as it progresses, it may cause

trouble swallowing
feeling like food is "stuck" in the chest
pain in the chest or between the shoulder blades
frequent heartburn or GERD
severe weight loss
hoarseness or chronic cough
vomiting

Other conditions can cause these symptoms. But if you have any of them, see your doctor.
