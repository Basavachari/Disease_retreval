Symptoms

Symptoms of parathyroid cancer may include:

a small lump in the front of the neck
pain in the back or side and blood in the urine (caused by kidney stones)
bone pain
hoarseness (caused by cancer invading the vocal cords or their nerves)
trouble swallowing
constipation
urinating more than normal
weakness
loss of appetite
weight loss for no known reason
vomiting
confusion and other neurological changes.

Because the rise in calcium can be gradual in people with parathyroid cancer, the body is able to adapt. Patients often have only minor symptoms, even if they have calcium levels that would be fatal if reached rapidly.

An enlarged parathyroid gland does not necessarily mean you have cancer. The gland can be enlarged for other reasons. For example, a noncancerous tumor called a parathyroid adenoma can cause a gland to enlarge.
