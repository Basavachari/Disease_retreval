Symptoms

Usually, the only symptom of molluscum contagiosum is the tiny bumps on the skin. These flesh-colored or pearly growths look somewhat like tiny pimples with a central crater. A waxy substance may come out of the bumps when they are squeezed. Itching may also occur.


In children, the bumps tend to appear on the face, arms, legs and middle of the body. In adults, molluscum contagiosum tends to appear on the genitals, thighs and lower abdomen because the infection usually is spread through sexual contact.

The bumps usually are grouped in one or two areas, but also can appear in many places on the body. Most people have fewer than 20 bumps. But people with weakened immune systems can develop several hundred bumps.

The bumps start out small, but can grow up to 3 to 6 millimeters (about a quarter of an inch or less). In rare cases, the bumps can become as large as about an inch. This might happen in a person with a weakened immune system, such as someone with advanced HIV infection.

Many people itch at the site of the lesions, but for some people the bumps cause no symptoms.
