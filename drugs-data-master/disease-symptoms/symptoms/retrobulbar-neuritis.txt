Symptoms

Symptoms usually worsen for two weeks and then stabilize. However, the course of the illness varies greatly. Most cases show some improvement over time, although complete recovery is rare. Optic neuritis usually affects only one eye, but both eyes may be affected. Common symptoms include:

Blurred or dimmed vision
A blind spot at or near the center of vision
Color "wash-out" so that colors are less rich
Pain with eye movement
Tenderness of the eye to touch or pressure
Complete blindness in the affected eye
