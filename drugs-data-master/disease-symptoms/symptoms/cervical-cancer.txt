Symptoms

In its early stages, cervical cancer does not cause any symptoms. When cervical cancer does cause symptoms, a woman may experience:

Blood-tinged or discolored vaginal discharge
Spotting after sex
Heavier and/or more prolonged menstrual bleeding
Vaginal bleeding between periods

These symptoms do not mean that you have cervical cancer. In fact, a woman may experience these symptoms for many reasons.

More advanced cervical cancer can cause:

Pelvic pain
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
A decrease in red blood cells (anemia)
