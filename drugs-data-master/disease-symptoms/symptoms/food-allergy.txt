Symptoms

It's not always easy to know when someone has a food allergy, because there are many different symptoms. They include:

Hives (a raised, pink, itchy rash)
Scratchy throat
Stomachache
Nausea or vomiting
Diarrhea
Swelling, especially around the mouth and face
Itchy eyes
Nasal congestion/runny nose
Other rashes, including eczema
Wheezing, or just trouble breathing
Difficulty with swallowing
Rapid heart rate
Lightheadedness
In babies and small children, poor growth or blood in the stool

In severe cases, something called anaphylaxis can happen. This whole-body allergic reaction combines many of the symptoms mentioned above and can lead to death if not treated immediately.
