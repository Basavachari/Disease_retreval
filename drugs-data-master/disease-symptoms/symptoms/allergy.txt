Symptoms

Symptoms depend on the type of allergic reaction. Pollen and pet dander allergies typically cause

sneezing
itchy and runny nose
stuffy nose
red, itchy, or watery eyes
itchy or sore throat.



Nasal congestion can lead to mouth breathing, and the dripping of excess mucus from the nose into the throat can cause persistent cough and sore throat.

The most common symptom of a drug allergy is a skin rash. If you have been exposed to the drug before, the rash may start quickly, within the first day or two after taking the drug. The reaction can also be delayed and can occur as late as 8 to 10 days after starting the drug. It is even possible to develop the rash after you have finished a one-week course of medication. When this does occur, it is usually related to an antibiotic.

Symptoms of anaphylaxis usually occur within seconds to minutes of exposure to the allergen, but symptoms can sometimes be delayed for several hours. Symptoms range from mild to very severe. They can include:

rapid pulse, sweating, dizziness, fainting, unconsciousness
wheezing, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, coughing
itchy hives, which may connect to form larger areas of skin swelling
swelling of the lips, tongue, or eyes
nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea
paleness, bluish skin color
throat swelling, with a feeling of throat tightness, a lump in the throat, hoarseness, or obstructed air flow.
