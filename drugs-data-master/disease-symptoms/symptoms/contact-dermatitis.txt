Symptoms

Symptoms of contact dermatitis may vary slightly, depending on the cause.

Irritant contact dermatitis. In mild cases, there may be only mild redness of the skin. More severe cases may cause skin swelling, blistering or ulceration.

Symptoms usually begin right after exposure to the harmful substance. They are limited to areas of the skin that have been in direct contact with the irritant. For example, a janitor may develop symptoms on his hands after washing the floor with a strong detergent.

Allergic contact dermatitis. This usually causes skin redness, blistering and severe itching. Symptoms may not appear for several hours or even days after exposure.


The location and pattern of the skin reaction may provide clues to the cause of the problem. For example, poison ivy usually appears as a pattern of tiny lines or streaks in places where plant leaves have brushed against the skin. Allergies to metal jewelry often cause rings of skin inflammation around the neck and wrist.

Contact dermatitis can become a long-lasting (chronic) condition. This is more likely if:

Symptoms of either type of dermatitis are not treated 
The skin continues to be exposed to the substance that is triggering the skin reaction

In chronic contact dermatitis, the skin eventually becomes thick, scaly and dry. Skin color changes and there are areas of hair loss.
