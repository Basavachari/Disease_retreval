Symptoms

Polycystic ovary syndrome usually does not cause symptoms before mid-puberty, when the ovaries begin to produce hormones in significant amounts. Women then can have some or all of the following symptoms:

Menstrual periods that are infrequent, irregular or absent
Difficulty getting pregnant
Obesity (in 40% to 50% of women with this condition)
Acne
Hair growth in the beard area, upper lip, sideburns, chest, the area around nipples or the lower abdomen along the midline
Darkened, thickened skin, sometimes appearing similar to velvet, in the armpits
