Symptoms

Symptoms of FD usually begin during infancy and become worse with age. These symptoms can include:

Poor sucking, with difficulty swallowing  
Frequent choking and gagging  
Repeated vomiting  
Poor weight gain  
Frequent lung infections caused by food and stomach juices that enter the lungs when the child chokes or vomits  
No flow of tears when the child cries  
Ulcers on the cornea, the clear membrane that covers the colored outside part of the eye  
Fewer taste buds than normal, especially on the front of the tongue  
Red skin blotches and excessive sweating, especially when the child eats or becomes excited  
Breath-holding spells that can cause fainting  
Slurred speech or a "nasal" voice  
Delayed development, especially difficulty walking  
Sores (ulcers) on the tongue caused by teeth rubbing against the area  
Decreased sense of pain and body position, which leads to frequent accidental injuries  
Curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and deformed joints  
Abnormally high or low body temperature and blood pressure  
Episodes of abnormally fast, slow or irregular heartbeat  
Loss of bladder control (enuresis)  
Delayed puberty, especially in girls  
Decreased reflexes and muscle tone  
Some children with FD may have repeated episodes of vomiting, called autonomic crises, which can occur every 15 to 20 minutes and can last for more than 24 hours. During these episodes, the child also may have very high blood pressure, a drenching sweat, skin blotches, pain in the abdomen, difficulty breathing and other symptoms. These episodes can be triggered by emotional or physical stress such as an infection.
