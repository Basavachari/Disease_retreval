Symptoms

The initial symptoms of acute hepatitis B vary. They can include:

Loss of appetite
Nausea
Vomiting
Fatigue
Headache
Fever
Itching
Weight loss
Abdominal pain
Sleep disturbance
Loss of sex drive

These symptoms may be followed by jaundice. Jaundice is a yellowing of the eyes and skin, and a darkening of the urine.

Most people recover from acute hepatitis. They are no longer infected with the virus when their illness ends.

However, about one in ten adults may develop chronic hepatitis. They remain infected by the virus, can develop chronic liver disease, and can pass the virus to other people.

People with chronic hepatitis may be free of symptoms for long periods. But symptoms eventually reappear. Symptoms, when they do occur, may include:

Fatigue
Jaundice (yellow color of the skin and eyes)
An ill feeling
Decreased appetite
Aching joints

A small number of people with chronic hepatitis develop liver cirrhosis. This is scarring of the liver that results in poor liver function. They may develop symptoms of advanced liver disease, including:

Jaundice
Fluid accumulation inside the abdomen
Swelling of the legs
Confusion
Gastrointestinal bleeding


People with hepatitis B who develop cirrhosis are at risk of developing liver cancer.
