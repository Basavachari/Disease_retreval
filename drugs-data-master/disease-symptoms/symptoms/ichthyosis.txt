Symptoms

Depending on the type of gene abnormality that causes ichthyosis, the skin can show different patterns of flaking. In most cases of ichthyosis vulgaris, for example, skin will flake over the majority of the body, but not on the inside surfaces of joints, in the groin area or on the face.


Symptoms of all genetic types of ichthyosis are either noticeable at birth or appear during childhood. Symptoms may include:

Severe dryness of the skin with thickening and flaking, which may be appear only in limited areas or may involve almost the entire skin surface
Mild itching of the skin
Body odor, because the spaces under and between skin flakes can harbor collections of bacteria or fungus
Wax buildup in the ears, causing hearing difficulties

Certain genetic conditions affect other parts of the body besides the skin, including nerve damage, deafness, or loss of the sense of smell.  Adults may develop ichthyosis due to certain cancers, such as lymphoma.

Skin dryness is usually worse in winter months and in dry climates, because warmth and humidity improve these symptoms. Many people who have ichthyosis vulgaris also have allergic problems, such as allergic nasal congestion, asthma or eczema.
