Symptoms

RSV tends to cause typical cold symptoms, including:

Sore throat 
Runny nose 
Stuffy nose 
Cough 
Wheezing 
Headache 
Fever

In general, the symptoms caused by RSV tend to be more severe than the average common cold. Symptoms generally begin within a week after an exposure to someone with an RSV infection.

In infants and children younger than age 3, or older children with underlying lung, heart or immune problems, RSV may start out looking like a mild cold with sneezing and runny nose. After two or three days, RSV can spread into the chest, causing a cough, breathing that is faster than normal and wheezing. Young children also can have a high fever. Infants with breathing difficulties may grunt; flare the nostrils; or have "retractions," which means the chest muscles are drawn in so that the ribs can be seen as the baby struggles to breathe.
