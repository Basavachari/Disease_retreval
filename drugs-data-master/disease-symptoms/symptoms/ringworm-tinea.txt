Symptoms

Symptoms of ringworm vary, depending on the site of the infection:

Ringworm of the scalp — Symptoms can include a diffuse, itchy, scaling of the scalp that resembles dandruff; itchy, scaly, round patches of hair loss on the scalp; black-dot ringworm, in which stubs of broken hairs form a dotted pattern on the scalp; or kerion, a thick, nodular patch of inflamed skin that may ooze pus.
Barber's itch — Symptoms often include kerion and crusted skin on bearded areas of the face and neck.
Ringworm of the body — This infection causes itchy, red, scaly, round patches with a raised border. Individual patches may be large or small and may occur alone or in groups of three to four.
Jock itch — Jock itch causes red, scaly patches that may itch or burn. These patches usually occur on the groin area and upper thigh, but not on the penis or scrotum.
Athlete's foot — Athlete's foot produces areas of redness, scaling or cracked skin on the feet, especially between the toes. The affected skin may itch or burn, and the feet may have a strong odor.
