Symptoms

The signs of rhabdomyosarcoma depend largely on the size and location of the cancer. These tumors may not cause symptoms until they are large.

Common symptoms include:

Persistent lump or swelling in the body that may be painful
Bulging of the eye or a drooping eyelid
Headache and nausea
Trouble urinating or having bowel movements
Blood in the urine
Earache or sinus infection symptoms
Bleeding from the nose, throat, vagina, or rectum
Vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation

These symptoms do not necessarily mean cancer. But it is important to contact your doctor if you or your child experiences any of them.
