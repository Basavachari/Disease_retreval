Symptoms

Symptoms vary depending on the type of renal failure.

Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure) — Symptoms may include:  

 Decreased urine output Swelling (edema) resulting from salt and water overload High blood pressure Nausea Vomiting Lethargy caused by the toxic effects of waste products on brain function

If left untreated, acute renal failure can cause  extra fluid to back up behind the heart into the lungs, cardiac rhythm abnormalities, behavioral changes, seizures and coma.

Chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal failure— Because the kidney damage in chronic renal failure occurs slowly over a long time, symptoms develop slowly, usually beginning when more than 80% of kidney function is lost. When this occurs, symptoms can include: 

 Headache Fatigue Weakness Lethargy Itching Poor appetite Vomiting  Increased thirst Pale skin High blood pressure Slowing of growth in children  Bone damage in adults
