Symptoms

Most people who have diverticulosis don't have any symptoms, but some have mild cramps, constipation or bloating. Diverticulitis causes more severe symptoms, including any of the following, but particularly the first two:

Steady abdominal pain


Tenderness to pressure in the lower abdomen, especially on the left side


Fever


Nausea


Vomiting


Chills


Cramping


Change in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea)


Sharper pain with breathing or jarring movements such as walking.

Lower intestinal bleeding can occur in people with diverticulosis. The loss of blood can cause weakness and dizziness.
