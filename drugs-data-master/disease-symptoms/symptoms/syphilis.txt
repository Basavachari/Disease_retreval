Symptoms

The symptoms of syphilis vary depending on the stage of the illness:

Primary syphilis — Usually, a single ulcer (chancre) appears at the site where the bacteria entered the body. The genitals are the most common location for chancres to develop, but these ulcers also can form around the mouth or anus. The chancre is firm and painless, and it oozes fluid that contains syphilis bacteria. Sometimes, lymph nodes near the ulcer become enlarged, but remain painless. The chancre of primary syphilis usually heals after one to five weeks, although the person remains infected.

Secondary syphilis — Typical symptoms of secondary syphilis are:

A rash, which may look like rough "copper penny" spots or fine red dots on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet
A skin rash on the arms, legs, and trunk — The rash can take a variety of forms, such as small blotches or indented circles; small blisters filled with pus; thick gray or pink patches
White patches inside the mouth and other mucous membranes.

Without treatment, rash symptoms usually go away after two to six weeks.

Other symptoms can include:

Enlarged lymph nodes (swollen glands)
Fever
Headaches
Muscle aches
Sore throat
Poor appetite
Weight loss
Feeling extremely tired

Without treatment, these other symptoms generally last about one year.

Latent stage — This stage does not cause any symptoms.


Tertiary syphilis — In this stage, syphilis causes symptoms related to severe organ damage. These symptoms can include:

Destructive tumors, called gummas, in the mouth, nose, tongue, bones, skin, liver or other organs
Chest pain or breathing difficulties related to heart valve damage or damage to the wall of the aorta (the major blood vessel bringing blood from the heart to the rest of the body)
Joint pain
Paralysis, coordination problems, loss of sensation, blindness, deterioration of intellectual function, personality changes and impotence due to nerve or brain damage
