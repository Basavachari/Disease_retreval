Symptoms

An innocent murmur does not cause any symptoms. For other types of heart murmurs, symptoms vary depending on the cause. In general, when a heart murmur significantly interferes with the heart's ability to pump blood, you can experience one or more of the following symptoms:

Shortness of breath 
Light-headedness 
Episodes of rapid heartbeat 
Chest pain 
Decreased tolerance for physical exertion and, in later stages, symptoms of heart failure
