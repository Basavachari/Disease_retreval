Symptoms

Normally, when you look at a person's spine from the front or back, it appears straight. When a person has scoliosis, the spine typically curves out to one side and then back again, or, more commonly, has two bowed-out areas that balance each other, resembling an S shape. Other signs can include:

One shoulder that appears lower than the other



A rounded shoulder
A sunken or asymmetrical (uneven) chest shape

Most people with scoliosis are not bothered by it other than abnormal posture and cosmetic concerns. If scoliosis is severe and untreated, it can cause additional problems, including:



Back pain that may appear in adulthood as ligaments weaken
Tingling or numbness in the legs
Permanent deformities
Fatigue (tiredness)
Breathing problems
Heart problems – Rarely, scoliosis is associated with abnormal heart mechanics, such as a heart valve abnormality known as mitral valve prolapse. It is not clear whether the abnormal shape of the upper body leads to this problem, or if the valve and spine both developed abnormally because of a single growth problem. 
A spine that curves inward or downward too much, known as a sway back
A pelvis that thrusts forward on one side
One leg that appears shorter than the other
