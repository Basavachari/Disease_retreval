Symptoms

If you have a fractured ankle, your symptoms probably will include:

Pain, swelling, tenderness and bruising at your ankle joint
Inability to move your ankle through its normal range of motion
Inability to bear weight on your injured ankle — However, if you can bear weight on the ankle, don't assume there is no fracture.
In some cases, a "crack" or "snap" in the ankle at the time of injury
In open fractures, severe ankle deformity, with portions of the fractured bone visible through broken skin
