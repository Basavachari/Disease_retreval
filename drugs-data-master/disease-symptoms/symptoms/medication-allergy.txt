Symptoms

Symptoms of drug allergies vary depending on the type of immune mechanisms involved. The most common reaction is a skin rash. If you have been exposed to the drug before, the rash may start quickly, within the first day or two after taking the drug. The reaction also can be delayed and not occur until 8 to 10 days after starting the drug. It is even possible to develop the rash after you have finished a one week course of medication. When this does occur, it is usually related to an antibiotic.

Symptoms that appear within hours of taking the drug — called acute symptoms — usually involve a skin rash, hives or itching. However, in more severe cases, symptoms can advance rapidly to include nasal congestion, rapid pulse rate, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, facial swelling, dizziness and light-headedness. This type of reaction, called anaphylaxis, represents the most serious kind of allergic reaction. Untreated, it can lead to death within minutes.

A less common type of allergic reaction is called serum sickness. This can occur days or even a week after starting a medication, even if you have never been exposed to the medication before. The symptoms of serum sickness include skin rashes, hives, fever and joint pain. In rare instances, a different type of allergic reaction can cause red blood cells to be destroyed. This is called hemolytic anemia.

If you develop sensitivity to one medication, using other medications with similar chemical structures can be risky. For example, if a person has developed hives or anaphylaxis after taking any of the penicillins, he or she should avoid taking a cephalosporin antibiotic such as cephalexin (Biocef, Keflex, Keftab).
