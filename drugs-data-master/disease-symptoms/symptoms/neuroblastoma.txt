Symptoms

Symptoms of a neuroblastoma include

a firm mass in the abdomen, with or without pain or discomfort
a swollen belly
trouble breathing (due to the mass pressing on the child’s lungs)
weight loss or inability to gain weight (called "failure to thrive")
anemia (a low number of red blood cells)
fever
crankiness
bone pain
bulging eyes, dark circles around the eyes ("panda eyes"), or a drooping eyelid
weakness, jerky movements, or difficulty walking
high blood pressure
rapid pulse
reddening (flushing) of the skin
sweating
severe diarrhea.

Some of these symptoms are caused by hormones that the cancer secretes. These hormones can affect blood pressure and heart rate. They can also cause flushing of the skin and sweating.

In some cases, neuroblastoma is diagnosed by chance before it causes symptoms. It may be discovered when the child has an x-ray to check for another illness.
