Symptoms

Symptoms of a deviated septum can include:

Blockage of one or both nostrils
Nasal congestion, sometimes on one side
Frequent nosebleeds
Frequent sinus infections
Facial pain, headaches, postnasal drip
Noisy breathing during sleep in infants and young children

In some cases, people with a mildly deviated septum have symptoms only when they also have a cold or other upper respiratory tract infection. In these people, the respiratory infection causes nose tissues to swell, which can make airflow problems worse. Once the cold goes away, the symptoms of a deviated septum often go away, too.
