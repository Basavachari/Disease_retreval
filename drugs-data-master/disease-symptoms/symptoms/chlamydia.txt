Symptoms

About 75% of women and 50% of men with chlamydia have no symptoms. This is why many infected people remain untreated and can continue to spread the infection to others.

In women, chlamydia can cause:

A burning sensation when urinating 
An abnormal vaginal discharge 
Light vaginal bleeding (especially after intercourse) 
Pain in the pelvis or lower abdomen  
In men, chlamydia can cause:  
An abnormal release of fluid that is not urine or semen (called penile discharge) 
A burning sensation when urinating
