Symptoms

Most kidney cancers grow without causing any pain or discomfort. Some are discovered before they begin to cause symptoms, such as when a person has a CT scan of the abdomen for another reason.

Renal cell carcinoma can cause a variety of symptoms that seem unrelated to the kidney. For example, it can spread into nearby veins, causing congestion or blockages within the veins. The tumor can also make too much of one or more hormones. Symptoms can result from the tumor itself, from vein blockage, or from the effect of hormones.

Some symptoms of kidney cancer include

blood in the urine
abdominal pain
a lump in the abdomen
fatigue
weight loss
unexplained fever
enlarged lymph nodes
enlarged veins in the scrotum (in males)
high blood pressure that is not easily controlled
trouble breathing or leg pain (due to blood clots)
a swollen abdomen (due to excess fluid)
bones that break easily.
