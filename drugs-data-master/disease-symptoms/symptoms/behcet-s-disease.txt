Symptoms

Symptoms are different in each person. They range from mild to severe.

People with Behçet's disease usually have painful, sores in the mouth that are quite similar or identical to canker sores. But while canker sores generally occur one at a time, people with Behçet's disease tend to have multiple sores.


More than half of people with Behçet's disease have sores around the genitals. These sores look like the mouth sores.

Behçet's disease can cause rashes, including acne-like bumps on the skin. It can cause inflammation around hair follicles. Blood clots can occur, usually in the legs. They can cause pain and tenderness.

Many people with Behçet's disease have joint pain and swelling, usually in the knees, ankles and wrists. The joints can be stiff and painful for several weeks at a time. But the disease usually does not cause long-term joint damage or deformity.

Up to three-quarters of people with Behçet's disease have eye inflammation. Specifically, a condition called uveitis usually shows up within two years of the first symptoms. At first, uveitis can cause blurred vision. Repeated flare-ups of uveitis can lead to decreased vision or even blindness.

In about 10% of cases, Behçet's disease causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include fever, stiff neck, headache and uncoordinated movements.

Rarely, Behçet's disease will inflame the intestinal tract. This can cause diarrhea, constipation, vomiting and stomach pain.
