Symptoms

Flu can cause a variety of symptoms. They can be mild or severe. Symptoms and illness severity depend on the type of virus, your age and overall health.

Although it is a respiratory virus, flu can affect other body systems. This makes you feel sick all over. Symptoms can include any or all of the following:

Chills 
Moderate to high fever (101 to 103 degrees Fahrenheit) 
Muscle aches 
Headaches 
Fatigue 
Cough 
Sore throat 
Runny nose 
Diarrhea 
Dizziness

Dangerous complications, such as pneumonia, can develop from flu. The influenza virus can be the direct cause of pneumonia. But also infection with influenza makes a person more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia.

Certain people are especially vulnerable to complications. These include:

Older people 
Infants 
People with certain chronic diseases 
People with suppressed immune systems
