Symptoms

Typical symptoms of acute tear duct infection include:

Pain, redness and swelling of the lower eyelid at the inner corner of the eye 
Excessive tearing 
Pus or discharge from the eye 
Fever

Symptoms of chronic (long-lasting) tear duct blockage are less severe. Although there may be tearing and perhaps some pus or discharge, usually there is little or no pain, redness or swelling.
