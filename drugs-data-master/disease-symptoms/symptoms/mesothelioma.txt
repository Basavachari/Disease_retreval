Symptoms

Almost everyone diagnosed with mesothelioma in the lungs or chest experiences chest pain or shortness of breath as the first symptom. These symptoms can be caused by the cancer itself, which irritates nerve cells in nearby tissues. They can also be caused by fluid building up between the two layers of the pleura.

People with mesothelioma in the abdominal lining may have abdominal pain and swelling caused by fluid build-up there.

Other possible symptoms include

A cough
Fatigue
Unexplained weight loss
