Symptoms

Most esophageal rings and webs do not cause any symptoms, and are discovered when people have barium X-rays or endoscopy for unrelated reasons. When rings or webs do cause symptoms, the most common complaint is difficulty swallowing solids. Foods, especially meats and breads, may feel like they get stuck in the same place.

Food occasionally can become lodged in the esophagus and require an endoscopic procedure to unblock the esophagus.
