Symptoms

Most people with mitral valve prolapse do not have any symptoms, and the condition is discovered only when a doctor hears a certain clicking sound with or without a heart murmur during a routine physical examination. In the past, mitral valve prolapse was blamed for symptoms such as chest pains, palpitations and lightheadedness. Although a person with mitral valve prolapse can also have these types of symptoms, mitral valve prolapse is not the cause.

People who have mitral regurgitation that continues to get worse can have symptoms of congestive heart failure (fatigue, shortness of breath, leg swelling).
