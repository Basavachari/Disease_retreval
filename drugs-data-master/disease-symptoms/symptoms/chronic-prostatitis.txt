Symptoms

Prostatitis usually causes swelling of the prostate gland. The prostate surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body from the bladder). The swollen prostate presses on the urethra causing pain or other problems with urination.

Typical symptoms of chronic prostatitis include:

Burning during or after urination
Difficulty starting the urine stream
Dribbling after urination has been completed
A need to urinate frequently or urgently
A sensation that the bladder cannot be emptied completely
Pain felt above the penis, in or below the scrotum, or in the back or rectum
Pain experienced during or after orgasm


In some men, symptoms may be hardly noticed or only slightly annoying. Other men are quite bothered by chronic prostatitis and find that the symptoms interfere with work, leisure activities and sexual enjoyment.
