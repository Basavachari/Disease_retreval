Symptoms

Pneumoconiosis sometimes does not cause any symptoms. When symptoms develop, they can include:

Cough (with or without mucus)  
Wheezing  
Shortness of breath, especially during exercise

If pneumoconiosis causes severe lung fibrosis, breathing can become extremely difficult. When this happens, the patient's lips and fingernails may have a bluish tinge. In very advanced disease, there also may be signs of leg swelling caused by too much strain on the heart.
