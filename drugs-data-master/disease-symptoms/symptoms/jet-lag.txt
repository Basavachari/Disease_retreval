Symptoms

Symptoms of jet lag can be mild or severe, depending on the number of time zones you cross and your sensitivity to such changes. The more time zones you cross, the more likely it is that your body rhythms will be disrupted, which can lead to more severe symptoms. Most people who cross five or more time zones will experience at least some symptoms, which can include:

Daytime sleepiness
Headaches
Insomnia
Restless sleep, possibly with frequent awakenings
Difficulty concentrating
Impaired judgment
Upset stomach or mild nausea
