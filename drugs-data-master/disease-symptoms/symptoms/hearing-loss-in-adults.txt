Symptoms

If you have sudden, severe hearing loss, you will notice immediately that your ability to hear has decreased dramatically or disappeared totally in the affected ear.

If your hearing loss is gradual, your symptoms may be more subtle. You may have difficulty understanding conversations. Family members may complain that you play the radio or TV too loudly. You may ask them to repeat what they say or frequently misunderstand what they are saying.

Some diseases and conditions that cause hearing loss may produce additional symptoms, including:

Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)


Discharge or bleeding from the ear


Deep earache, or pain in the ear canal


Pressure or a "stuffy" feeling inside the ears


Dizziness or problems with balance or equilibrium


Nausea
