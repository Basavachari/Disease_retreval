Symptoms

The classic symptoms of acute pericarditis are chest pain and fever. This chest pain can be either brief and sharp or steady and constricting. It is usually under the breastbone, but it also can spread to the neck or shoulders. In many patients, chest pain becomes more severe if they take a deep breath, swallow, cough, or lie down. Sitting up or leaning forward may relieve the pain.

Patients with cardiac tamponade can have low blood pressure and shortness of breath. Patients with constrictive pericarditis also can have breathing difficulties, together with edema (swelling) of the ankles, legs and abdomen.
