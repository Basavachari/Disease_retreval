Symptoms

Acoustic neuromas generally grow slowly so the symptoms develop gradually and are easy to miss or misinterpret. The earliest and most common symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are:

Loss of hearing in one ear — This usually is gradual, but can occur suddenly in 10% of cases.
Tinnitus, a ringing, buzzing or noisy sound in the ear when there is no external sound present.

Less common symptoms include:

Dizziness or loss of balance
Numbness in the face
Headache
Facial weakness
Mental confusion
