Symptoms

In women, Trichomonas organisms can live in the vagina for many years without causing symptoms. If symptoms occur, they can include:

A yellow-green, foul-smelling vaginal discharge
Vaginal pain or itching
Irritation and inflammation around the vaginal opening
Vaginal pain during sexual intercourse
Burning discomfort during urination

In rare cases there will be discomfort in the lower abdomen. Symptoms may be worse during a menstrual period. Although men usually have no symptoms, they occasionally can have irritation and inflammation at the tip of the penis, discomfort during urination, and a discharge from the end of the penis.
