Symptoms

The majority (80%) of patients with group A streptococcal toxic shock syndrome have symptoms of a soft-tissue infection (pain, redness, warmth, swelling) in an area just below the skin or in a muscle. Patients with staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome may have a staphylococcal infection anywhere in the body and the site of infection may not be immediately apparent.

Symptoms of toxic shock include:

Flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea  
Hypotension (low blood pressure) with a weak and rapid pulse  
A red rash that covers the whole body, sometimes followed by peeling skin (the rash may be difficult to see in dark-skinned individuals) 
Decreased urine output 
Confusion, disorientation or other mental changes  
Swelling in the hands, feet and ankles  
Severe breathing difficulties
