Symptoms

The symptoms of Takayasu's arteritis vary depending on the stage of the illness and the arteries affected. Early symptoms can include fever, fatigue, poor appetite, weight loss, night sweats, joint pain and chest pain. Later symptoms typically are related to narrowing of the arteries and a decrease in blood flow to certain organs. These later symptoms can include:

Headache, nausea or fatigue related to high blood pressure and kidney failure  
Chest pain, especially with exertion  
Shortness of breath and fatigue, resulting from congestive heart failure  
Fainting, dizziness, changes in vision, transient ischemic attacks (mini strokes) or a stroke, resulting from poor blood flow to the brain  
Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, resulting from poor blood flow to the abdomen  
Muscle weakness and pain in the arms or legs when they are moved
