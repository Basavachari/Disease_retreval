Symptoms

Typical symptoms of motor tics include involuntary (uncontrolled) muscular movements of the mouth or eyes, head twitching, and shoulder shrugging. Examples of less common, complex tic symptoms are bending over to touch the floor, smoothing clothing and jumping.

Vocal tics are involuntary expressions, such as noises, words (sometimes obscenities) or repetitive phrases (in some cases with increasing rapidity).

Symptoms vary greatly among people with tic disorders, ranging from barely observable tics to severe and incapacitating symptoms. Fatigue, anxiety and other stressful events often make symptoms worse in people with tic disorders.
