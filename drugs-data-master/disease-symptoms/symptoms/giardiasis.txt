Symptoms

Up to two-thirds of people infected with the organism do not have any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can appear suddenly and be obvious or they may worsen slowly. Typically, symptoms start one to three weeks after exposure and include:

Watery diarrhea
Abdominal cramping
Bloating
Nausea with or without vomiting
Gas
Floating or unusually smelly stools
Weight loss
New intolerance to milk and dairy foods in your diet
Low-grade fever
Loss of appetite

Some of the symptoms can take several months or more to begin because they are caused by gradual changes in the lining of your intestine. G. lamblia interferes with the body's ability to absorb fats, so your stools may have more fat in them during a Giardia infection. This is why your stools may float and smell foul.
