Symptoms

Among the possible signs and symptoms of AML are:

Unexplained and persistent fever
Marked fatigue and weakness
Unexpected weight loss with poor appetite
Easy bruising or bleeding
Serious infections

Leukemia cells that spread to the brain and spinal cord can cause:

Severe and persistent headache
Seizures
Trouble with balance

AML is not a common disease. So most often the above symptoms are caused by some other medical condition.
