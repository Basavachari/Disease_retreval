Symptoms

In about 15% to 20% of patients, mumps does not cause any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they usually begin 14 to 18 days after exposure to someone with a mumps infection.

In about half of patients, symptoms of mumps infection may include fever, headache, sore throat, muscle aches, poor appetite and malaise (a general feeling of sickness). The mumps virus causes pain and swelling in front of the earlobe, called parotitis. Because of the pain of parotitis, chewing and swallowing may be very uncomfortable, and the patient may not feel like eating.

Infrequently, male teenagers and adults with mumps can develop swelling and pain in one or both testes (orchitis). In women, the ovaries may be involved, which can cause lower abdominal pain.

In patients of either sex, but more commonly in adults than in children, there also may be more serious complications including:

Mumps pancreatitis, which causes pain in the upper abdomen
Aseptic (not bacterial) meningitis, which causes headache, stiff neck and drowsiness
Mumps encephalitis, which causes high fever and unconsciousness, although this occurs in less than one in 1,000 patients with mumps
