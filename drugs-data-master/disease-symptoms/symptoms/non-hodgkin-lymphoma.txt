Symptoms

Some people do not notice any signs or symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Instead, the disease may be found during a routine doctor’s exam.

The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a swollen lymph node. It feels like a painless lump under the skin in the neck, armpit, or groin area.

Other typical symptoms include

fever for no known reason


extreme fatigue and weakness


unexplained weight loss


drenching night sweats


a rash or very itchy skin


pain in the chest, abdomen, or bones.

In most cases, these symptoms are not caused by cancer. However, it is important to see a doctor if you or your child experience any of them.
