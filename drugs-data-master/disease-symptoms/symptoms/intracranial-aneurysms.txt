Symptoms

Most brain aneurysms don’t cause symptoms until they burst. When an aneurysm ruptures, it often causes bleeding in the brain, which is a medical emergency. Bleeding in the brain usually leads to a very severe headache (often described as "the worst headache of my life"). Brief loss of consciousness, nausea and vomiting, changes in vision, or neck stiffness may accompany the headache. If you experience these symptoms, call 911 or get to the emergency room as soon as possible.

A very large aneurysm may cause symptoms before it bursts, including: pain above and behind the eye; numbness, weakness, or paralysis on one side of the face; dilated pupils; and vision changes.
