Symptoms


Symptoms of appendicitis include:

Abdominal pain, usually starting just above the belly button and then moving to the right lower side of the abdomen



Nausea
Vomiting



If you have symptoms of appendicitis, do not take enemas or laxatives to relieve constipation: These medicines increase the chance that the appendix will burst. Also, avoid taking pain-relief medicines before seeing your doctor, because these medications can mask appendicitis symptoms and make diagnosis difficult.

Abdominal swelling
Pain when the right side of the abdomen is touched
Low-grade fever
Inability to pass gas
Change in normal bowel pattern
