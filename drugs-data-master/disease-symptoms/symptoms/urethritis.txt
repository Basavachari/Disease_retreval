Symptoms

The main symptoms of urethritis are pain or burning during urination and an urge to urinate more frequently. Another symptom is redness around the opening of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. Men with gonococcal urethritis also often have a yellow discharge from the urethra.

Women are less likely to have symptoms from sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.
