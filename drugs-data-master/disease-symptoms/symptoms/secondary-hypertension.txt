Symptoms

New guidelines define high blood pressure as persistent readings of 120/80 mm Hg. However, people with secondary hypertension will be diagnosed when they have readings of at least 14/90 mm Hg. Most often doctors start to consider secondary hypertension when blood pressure is not controlled with two or three different medications or if the person has symptoms related to the underlying condition.

For example, a tumor of the adrenal gland called a pheochromocytoma can cause sweating, palpitations, severe anxiety and weight loss. In Cushing's syndrome, there may be weight gain, weakness, abnormal growth of body hair and loss of menstrual periods in women, and the appearance of purple "stretch marks" on the abdomen (abdominal striae). Hyperparathyroidism with elevated calcium levels can cause extreme tiredness, increased urination, constipation and kidney stones. Hyperaldosteronism often causes weakness related to low blood potassium levels.
