Symptoms

The main symptom of a tension headache is a sense of tightness around the head. This is sometimes described as a "tight hat-band" or "vise" sensation.

Neck and shoulder muscles are often tense and sore to the touch. The person may have trouble concentrating and difficulty sleeping.

A person can have both migraine and tension-type headaches. And the symptoms of tension-type headaches and migraine headaches can overlap. For example, both types of headaches may be made worse by bright lights or loud noises. In general, migraine headaches tend to be throbbing. Tension-type headaches cause a more constant pain. But the pain of a migraine or tension-type headache can be steady or throbbing or alternate between the two.
