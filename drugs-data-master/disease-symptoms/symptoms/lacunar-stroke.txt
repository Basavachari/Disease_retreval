Symptoms

The symptoms of lacunar stroke vary depending on the part of the brain that is deprived of its blood supply. Different areas of the brain are responsible for different functions, such as sensation, movement, sight, speech, balance and coordination.

Symptoms can include:

Weakness or paralysis of the face, arm, leg, foot or toes
Sudden numbness
Difficulty walking
Difficulty speaking
Clumsiness of a hand or arm
Weakness or paralysis of eye muscles
Other neurological symptoms

In a person with prolonged, untreated high blood pressure, multiple lacunar strokes can occur. This can cause additional symptoms to develop, including emotional behavior and dementia.

The sudden appearance of one or more of these symptoms is a warning sign that a stroke may be in progress. Sometimes, the small clots that can cause a lacunar stroke interfere with blood flow only for a few minutes. If the clot dissolves before damage is done, then symptoms can begin to improve within minutes and may go away completely. When symptoms go away without treatment and full recovery occurs within 24 hours, the event is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Never decide to wait and see whether stroke symptoms will go away on their own. Get to an emergency room as quickly as possible to get treatment.
