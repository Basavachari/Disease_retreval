Symptoms


The most common symptoms of chondrosarcoma are

pain in the affected area that may worsen at night or during physical activity
swelling in the painful area
a lump or mass
enlargement of an existing growth
limping
difficulty moving the affected limb
changes in urination (for pelvic tumors).

These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have cancer. Still, it is important to see a doctor if you experience any of them.
