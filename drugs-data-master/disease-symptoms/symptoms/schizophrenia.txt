Symptoms

The symptoms of schizophrenia are often defined as either "positive" or "negative."

Positive symptoms

Delusions (distorted thoughts, false beliefs)
Hallucinations (disordered perceptions) that may involve any of the five senses, including sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste
Disorganized speech
Unusual motor activity or disorganized behavior


Negative symptoms

Restricted emotional range ("flat affect")
Limited, unresponsive speech with little expression
Trouble starting or continuing goal-directed activity

Negative symptoms may represent a reduced ability to express emotions. People with schizophrenia may also have trouble experiencing pleasure, which may lead to apathy.

Cognitive or intellectual symptoms are harder to detect and include problems retaining and using information for the purpose of organizing or planning.
