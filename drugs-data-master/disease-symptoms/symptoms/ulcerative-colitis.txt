Symptoms

The symptoms of ulcerative colitis vary. Some people with the disease have a burst of symptoms every few months. Others have symptoms all the time. Some, fortunately, have symptoms only rarely.

Typical symptoms include:

Cramping abdominal pain, especially in the lower abdomen
Bloody diarrhea, often containing pus or mucus
Little warning before you need to have a bowel movement
The need to wake from sleep to have bowel movements

Ulcerative colitis also may cause:

Fever
Fatigue
