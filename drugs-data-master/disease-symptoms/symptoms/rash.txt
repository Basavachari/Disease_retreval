Symptoms

Although rash is easily recognized, all rashes are not the same. Rashes vary in their appearance, timing, location or distribution, and duration. In general, rashes can be described as:

Macular — Flat, red spots  
Papular — Small, raised, solid bumps  
Macular and papular — A combination  
Papulosquamous — A combination of papules and scaly areas  
Vesicular — Small, raised, fluid-filled blisters

Additional signs and symptoms that sometimes accompany rashes include:

Fever  
Swollen lymph nodes (swollen glands)  
Signs of a severe allergic, potentially life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis, which requires immediate emergency medical attention: difficulty breathing, hives, vomiting, abdominal cramps, rapid drop in blood pressure, confusion and unconsciousness  
Signs of an autoimmune disorder, such as lupus (may include fatigue, poor appetite, fever, joint swelling) or dermatomyositis (often includes weak muscles, swelling and violet discoloration of the eyelids and difficulty rising after sitting)
