Symptoms

Common symptoms of a fractured collarbone include:

Pain, swelling and tenderness along your collarbone
Pain when you try to move your shoulder or arm
Slumping of your shoulder downward, forward and inward
Abnormal contour of your collarbone — the fractured area may cause an abnormal bump along the length of your collarbone, or it may poke forward to produce a sharp point under the skin at the front of your shoulder. In rare cases, the end of the broken collarbone may penetrate through the surface skin and be exposed.
Bruising or abrasions along your collarbone, or at the top or side of your shoulder

Your doctor will examine your collarbone, shoulder and upper chest for swelling, deformity, abrasions, bruising and tenderness along the length of your collarbone. Your doctor also will press and feel the injured area gently to determine the position of any broken bone fragments under the skin.

To determine whether blood vessels or nerves were injured by the fractured collarbone, the doctor will check the strength of your pulse at your wrist and elbow, and will check the feeling and strength in your arm, hand and fingers. The doctor will also check your upper chest with a stethoscope to determine if your lungs have been damaged.

If the results of your physical examination suggest that that you have a fractured clavicle, your doctor will order X-rays to confirm the diagnosis.
