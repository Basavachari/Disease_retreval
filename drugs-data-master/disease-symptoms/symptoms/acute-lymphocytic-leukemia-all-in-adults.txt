Symptoms

Among the possible signs and symptoms of ALL are:

Unexplained and persistent fever
Marked fatigue and weakness
Unexpected weight loss with poor appetite
Easy bruising or bleeding, due to low platelets in the blood (platelets are small cells involved in blood clotting).

Leukemia cells that spread to the brain and spinal cord can cause:

Severe and persistent headache
Seizures
Trouble with balance

ALL is not a common disease in adults. So most often the above symptoms are caused by some other medical condition.

Most often the above symptoms are caused by some other condition, not ALL. However, you should always contact your doctor if you experience any of them.
