Symptoms

A partial seizure can imitate any type of behavior or sensation that the brain can cause, depending on the part of the brain that the seizure activates. Seizures tend to occur in the same area of brain over and over, so symptoms in one person seem very similar from one time to the next. Examples of the symptoms of partial seizures include:

Abrupt jerking muscle movements in an arm or leg
Chewing or other mouth or tongue movements, or pulling or fumbling with clothing without a purpose
A blank stare with no apparent awareness of one's surroundings



A sudden feeling of fear, joy or rage that comes without reason
Repeating a phrase or word
A change in vision or a hallucination (seeing something that is not real)
A sensation of smell or taste, usually unpleasant, that does not come from a real object or food
Sudden loss of balance or dizziness


After a seizure, a person may be disoriented for a few minutes.
