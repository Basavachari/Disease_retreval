Symptoms

Most aortic aneurysms don't cause any symptoms. They often are discovered during routine physical exams. Or they are found on X-rays for unrelated illnesses.

When symptoms develop, they can include:

Pain in the:
 AbdomenBackFleshy part of the sides, between the bottom of the ribs and hips
A feeling of fullness after eating a small meal
Nausea and vomiting
A pulsating mass in the abdomen

Rarely, floating blood clots form near the aneurysm. These clots can break away. They can block blood vessels elsewhere in the body.

Sometimes an undiscovered abdominal aneurysm ruptures without warning. The patient collapses and dies from massive bleeding inside the abdomen.

Diagnosis

Your doctor will ask about your family history of heart disease. He or she will want to know about any sudden and, perhaps, unexplained, deaths in the family.

Your doctor will ask if you smoke. The doctor will check for high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes.

Your doctor may suspect an aortic aneurysm based on the physical examination. Your doctor may hear abnormal blood flow in your abdomen. Or, your doctor may see and feel a pulsating mass in your abdomen.

In most people an abdominal aortic aneurysm is found on an imaging study for an unrelated illness. Aortic aneurysms can be seen on many different imaging studies. These include x-rays and ultrasound.

Ultrasound is a very accurate test for abdominal aortic aneurysm. And it doesn't expose the patient to radiation.
