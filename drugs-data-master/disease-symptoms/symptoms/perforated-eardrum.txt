Symptoms

Symptoms of a perforated eardrum include:

Earache or sudden relief of an earache
Hearing loss in the affected ear
Bleeding or fluid discharge from the ear canal
Ringing noise in the ear

The level of hearing loss depends on the size of the perforation and what caused it. Trauma to the ear or head can injure the middle ear, inner ear or both, and can cause severe hearing loss. If an explosion has torn the eardrum, you may have ringing in your ears (tinnitus) for several days, as well as hearing loss. If the perforated eardrum becomes infected, the hearing loss may worsen.
