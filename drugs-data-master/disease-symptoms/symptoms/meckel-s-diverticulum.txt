Symptoms

Most people with Meckel's diverticulum do not experience any symptoms. Symptoms occur only if the diverticulum bleeds, becomes infected or causes an obstruction. These symptoms generally occur during the first few years of life, although they may not appear until adulthood. The bleeding, even when severe, is usually painless. An infection and blockage can cause mild to severe abdominal pain and discomfort.

Signs and symptoms may include:

Passage of blood with or without stools
Blood in stools, either visible or detectable only with a test
Mild to severe abdominal pain
Iron deficiency anemia and its accompanying symptoms (paleness and fatigue)
