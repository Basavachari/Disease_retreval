Symptoms

Children with blood lead levels of 5–25 mcg/dL usually do not show any obvious symptoms of too much lead in the body. The damage may not be obvious. It only becomes noticeable at school age, when the child shows signs of possible learning disabilities, behavioral problems or mental retardation.

At higher exposures, children may experience:  
Decreased production of red blood cells (anemia)  
Tiredness and fatigue  
Headaches  
Severe abdominal pain and cramps  
Hearing problems  
Slowed growth  
Persistent vomiting  
Convulsions  
Coma


Adults with blood lead levels of 40–50 mcg/dL may display some of the same symptoms, or any of the following:

Inability to sleep  
Memory and concentration problems  
Infertility  
Kidney damage  
High blood pressure

In pregnant women:

Stillbirths 
Miscarriages
