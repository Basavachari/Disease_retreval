Symptoms

People with COPD commonly have symptoms of both chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

Chronic Bronchitis
Chronic bronchitis may have different symptoms in different people.

Your first symptom may be a morning cough that brings up mucus. At first it may only occur during the winter months. In milder cases, a cough produces only a small amount of thin, clear mucus. In other people, the mucus is thick and discolored.

As the illness progresses, the cough begins to last throughout the day and year. It produces more mucus. Symptoms similar to asthma may develop. These include wheezing and shortness of breath.

Eventually, you may develop:

A continuous cough
Breathlessness
Rapid breathing
A bluish tint to the skin from lack of oxygen

Over time, the airways narrow. Blood pressure increases in the arteries that feed the lungs. This strains the right side of the heart. Eventually, heart failure may develop. Blood backs up in the liver, abdomen and legs.

Chronic bronchitis also makes you prone to frequent respiratory infections. It increases the risk of potentially life-threatening breathing difficulties. These often require hospitalization.

Emphysema
If you have emphysema, you may first feel short of breath during activities such as walking or vacuuming. Lung function decreases slowly in emphysema. You may hardly notice the change as breathing becomes more and more difficult.

With time, you may develop:

Increased shortness of breath
Wheezing
Coughing
Tightness in the chest
A barrel-like distended chest
Constant fatigue
Difficulty sleeping
Weight loss
