Symptoms

The symptoms of hypoparathyroidism result from the low levels of calcium in the body. The most common symptom is muscle cramps or tightness and tingling of the lips or fingers. This condition is known as tetany, which causes twitching and painful spasms in muscles of the face, hands, arms, throat and, sometimes, the feet. Seizures also can occur, but they are rare.

In addition to tetany, symptoms accompanying hereditary hypoparathyroidism can include:

Hair loss 
Dry skin 
Yeast infection (candidiasis), typically of the fingernails, toenails, skin, mouth (thrush) or vagina 
Poor tooth development in children 
Mental retardation
