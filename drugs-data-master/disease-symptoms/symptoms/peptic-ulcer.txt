Symptoms

Most people with ulcers complain of a burning or gnawing pain in the upper abdomen. This typically occurs when the stomach is empty. These symptoms may be worse at night or upon waking. However, some people's pain may worsen when they eat.


Other symptoms include:

Nausea 


Vomiting 


Loss of appetite 


Bloating 


Burping  


Weight loss

Some of these symptoms may be relieved by taking over-the-counter antacids or avoiding spicy or acidic foods.

In general, symptoms worsen as an ulcer grows, or if more than one ulcer develops. Some people with mild disease don't have any symptoms.

In more severe cases, ulcers may bleed or extend deep into the wall of the stomach or intestine. Bleeding from large ulcers can be life threatening. Blood may appear in the vomit. It may appear either red or black, or resemble coffee grounds. Blood also may appear in the stools, which would look tarry-black or maroon.

Peritonitis is a very serious abdominal infection. It may develop if the ulcer eats completely through the wall of the stomach or intestine
