Symptoms

Some characteristics of stuttering speech include:

Repeating a sound ("c-c-c-cat"), a syllable ("ad-ad-ad-advice"), a whole word or a phrase  
Stretching out a sound ("r----ound") or a syllable ("ta-------ble")  
Long pauses or hesitations in the normal flow of speech  
Rushed sentences or phrases, as the child hurries to express a complete thought or idea before stuttering starts  
Physical signs that the child is struggling to "force out" words, including grimaces, tight facial muscles, quivering (tremors) around the mouth and eye blinking

It is important to note that most children repeat sounds or syllables and pronounce words incorrectly when they are learning to speak. This is referred to as normal dysfluency.

However, with true stuttering, these speech behaviors occur more often and repetitions of sounds or words last longer than half a second. In addition, normal problems with fluency tend to come and go, or happen only at certain times (such as when a child is tired or excited), but true stuttering is present most of the time.

Once a child begins to stutter, he or she may feel embarrassed, self-conscious or anxious when asked to speak. The child may find it hard to socialize with friends and also may intentionally avoid situations where talking is expected, such as telephone calls, classroom discussions and school plays.

Somewhat unexpectedly, many children who stutter have no problem when they sing. According to some experts, this is because speaking and singing often come from opposite sides of the brain, especially in right-handed people.
