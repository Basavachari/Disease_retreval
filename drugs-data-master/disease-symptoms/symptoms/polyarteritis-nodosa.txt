Symptoms

In most people, polyarteritis nodosa develops gradually over weeks to months. The first symptoms include fever, weight loss, weakness, a generally sick feeling (called malaise), muscle aches, headaches or abdominal pain. These complaints are called nonspecific, because many illnesses and diseases produce the same symptoms. Eventually, these symptoms are followed by specific signs of arterial damage to one or more organs. Depending on the location and severity of the damage, any of the following symptoms can occur:

Symptoms of high blood pressure or kidney failure, including severe headache, fluid retention, nausea and confusion
Nausea, vomiting or severe abdominal pain
Seizures, changes in mental function, numbness, tingling or weakness, slurred speech
Pain in muscles or joints
Skin rashes, nodules, hives, a red or purple rash (called purpura) caused by bleeding from damaged capillaries, or larger hemorrhages under the skin
Chest pain or shortness of breath
Pain in the testicles or pelvis

Because polyarteritis nodosa can cause such a wide variety of symptoms, no two people experience it in exactly the same way.  And it can be difficult to diagnose quickly.
