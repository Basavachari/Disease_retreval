Symptoms

Newborn babies with PKU usually do not show any symptoms, although they may be irritable, vomit or feed poorly . If babies are untreated they start to show developmental delays at a few months of age and the delays can become very severe.


Children with PKU have lower levels of melanin, the substance that gives color to hair and skin. That's because when phenylalanine is broken down, one of its products is used to make melanin. As a result, children with PKU often will have pale skin, blond hair and blue eyes. Dry skin; eczema; and a "musty" odor resulting from the buildup of phenylalanine in hair, skin and urine are also common. Other signs and symptoms may include irritability, muscle stiffness, seizures, a small head and short stature.
