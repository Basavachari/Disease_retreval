Symptoms

Many people with stomach cancer do not have any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can be so vague that people ignore them. The symptoms of stomach cancer are also common symptoms of other gastrointestinal problems, such as stomach ulcers and viruses.

The most common symptoms of stomach cancer include

bloating after meals
nausea
loss of appetite
recurrent indigestion or heartburn
diarrhea or constipation.

Other symptoms include

sudden weight loss
vomit blood (red or coffee-ground appearance)
black, tarry stools (from blood digested in the stomach).
