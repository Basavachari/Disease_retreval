Symptoms

A seizure begins suddenly. Without warning, the person loses consciousness and experiences the following symptoms:

Becomes rigid (extends the arms and legs, arches the back) and falls down
Utters a cry (the "epileptic cry") as the diaphragm contracts and forces air out between the contracted vocal cords
Has jerking movements of the arms, legs, and trunk muscles
Involuntarily passes urine and sometimes feces


The seizure usually subsides within two minutes or less, leaving the person confused and sleepy. Over the following 24 hours, he or she may complain of sore muscles, headache, fatigue and difficulty concentrating.
