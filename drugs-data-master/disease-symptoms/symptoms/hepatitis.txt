Symptoms

Symptoms of hepatitis vary. They depend on the cause of the illness and how much the liver has been damaged.

In mild cases, many people do not have any symptoms. Or they may have flu-like symptoms. These can include:

Fever
A generally tired or ill feeling
Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting
Fatigue
Discomfort in the upper right side of the abdomen
Muscle aches

In more severe cases, chemicals from the liver can build up in the blood and urine. This can cause:

A yellow tint to the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
Dark, tea-colored urine
Light, gray-colored stools
