Symptoms

Symptoms of osteoarthritis include:

Joint pain and swelling after activity or in response to a change of weather 
Limited flexibility, especially after not moving for a while 
Bony lumps at the end of fingers, called Heberden's nodes, or on the middle joints of fingers, called Bouchard's nodes 
A grinding sensation when the joint is moved 
Numbness or tingling in an arm or leg, which can happen if the arthritis has caused bone changes that are putting pressure on a nerve; for example, in the neck or lower back


People who have osteoarthritis often complain of a deep ache, centered in the joint. Typically, the pain is aggravated by using the joint and relieved by rest. However, as the disease worsens, the pain becomes more constant. Often, when the pain is significant during the night, it interferes with sleep.
