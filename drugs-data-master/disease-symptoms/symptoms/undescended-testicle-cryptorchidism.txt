Symptoms

There is usually only one sign that a boy has an undescended testicle. The scrotum appears underdeveloped or smaller on the affected side. In rare cases, the undescended testicle can become twisted (testicular torsion), causing severe groin pain. If this happens, seek medical attention immediately.
