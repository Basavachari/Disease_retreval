Symptoms

Early on, squamous cell lung cancer may have no symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may include

a cough that doesn't go away
coughing up blood or mucus
shortness of breath or trouble breathing
wheezing
fatigue
discomfort when swallowing
chest pain
fever
hoarseness
unexplained weight loss
poor appetite
high levels of calcium in the blood.

If the cancer has spread beyond the lungs, it can cause other symptoms. For example, you may have bone pain if it has spread to your bones, or headaches and seizures if it has spread to your brain.

Many of these symptoms can be caused by other conditions. See your doctor if you have symptoms so that the problem can be diagnosed and properly treated.
