Symptoms

This cancer often doesn't cause any symptoms in its early stages. The tumor may grow for some time before the problem becomes noticeable. When symptoms occur, they include

having blurry vision
seeing spots
seeing flashing lights
having severe eye pain.

Having these symptoms doesn't mean you have choroidal melanoma. These symptoms can be caused by other conditions that are more common—and noncancerous. In fact, seeing spots and flashing lights are very common symptoms. And they are rarely related to choroidal melanoma.
