Symptoms

A felon causes extreme pain at the fingertip, especially when pressure is applied to the "fingerprint" surface. The end of the finger swells, is warm and turns red. There may be an accumulation of a white, thick discharge (pus). As the felon increases, the fingertip may feel numb, and bending the finger may be painful.
