Symptoms

Symptoms of cluster headache include:

Intense pain localized around one eye or near the temple. Pain is deep and explosive. It usually builds to maximum intensity within five minutes. The pain can spread to nearby areas of the cheek or jaw.



A bloodshot or tearing eye on the affected side
Smaller pupil or droopy eyelid on the affected side
Runny nose or blocked nostril on the affected side

Many people feel better when they remain active during their headaches. This is in contrast to those experiencing migraine headaches. Migraine sufferers tend to seek out a quiet, dark room.
