Symptoms

An infestation with body lice often causes intense itching, which is an allergic reaction to their saliva. The reaction to the bites may appear as small welt-like marks and, possibly, redness and swelling, particularly around the neck and on the torso. A heavy, long-lasting infestation may produce a darkening and thickening of the skin, fatigue and other symptoms. Scratching the bites can lead to infection.

In certain underdeveloped and war-torn parts of the world and places with poor sanitation and overcrowding, body lice may transmit the microbes that cause trench fever, louse-borne relapsing fever and louse-borne (epidemic) typhus. Trench fever and endocarditis from this infection have emerged as diseases affecting homeless and destitute populations in large cities of North America and Europe.
