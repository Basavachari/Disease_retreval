Symptoms

The most common symptom of a head lice infestation is itching. This is caused mainly by the louse's saliva, which irritates the skin on the scalp. The itching can occasionally be severe enough to prevent sleep, and some people scratch so much that they cause additional skin infections. Head lice are not known to transmit any infections.
