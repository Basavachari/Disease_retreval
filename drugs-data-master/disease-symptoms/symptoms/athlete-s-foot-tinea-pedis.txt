Symptoms

Symptoms of athlete's foot include:

Intense itching of the feet
Cracked, blistered or peeling areas of skin, especially between the toes




Redness and scaling on the soles



In most people, signs of infection are seen on the webbed skin between the toes. In some people, the infection spreads to one or more toenails, causing the nail to appear unusually thick and cloudy yellow.
