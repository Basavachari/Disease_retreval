Symptoms

Symptoms of Osgood-Schlatter disease include:

Pain, tenderness and swelling of the soft tissues at the top of the shin bone, just below the kneecap



Redness and warmth below the kneecap
A bony bump at the top of the shinbone

The pain from Osgood-Schlatter disease can be a mild pain that lasts only while playing sports, or it can be a constant pain that severely limits regular participation in athletic activities. Pain can occur during stair climbing, kneeling, squatting or kicking. Pain usually appears in only one knee, although in about 20% to 30% of cases, both knees are affected.
