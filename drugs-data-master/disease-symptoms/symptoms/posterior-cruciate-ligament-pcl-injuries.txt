Symptoms

Symptoms of a PCL injury may include:

Mild knee swelling, with or without the knee giving out when you walk or stand, and with or without limitation of motion
Mild pain at the back of the knee that feels worse when you kneel
Pain in the front of the knee when you run or try to slow down — This symptom may begin one to two weeks after the injury or even later.

Because the first symptoms of a PCL tear may not interfere significantly with an athlete's ability to play sports, many athletes with PCL injuries wait several weeks before they see a doctor. At that first office visit, the athlete may describe vague or nonspecific symptoms — for example, that the injured knee simply doesn't feel "the way it should."
