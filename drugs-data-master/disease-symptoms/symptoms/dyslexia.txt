Symptoms

A person with dyslexia may have a hard time with:

Identifying words  
Recognizing the sounds that make up words  
Understanding and remembering what is read  
Translating printed words into spoken words  
Spelling  
Organizing or sequencing thoughts  
Rhyming words  
Learning the alphabet and numbers during preschool and kindergarten

For example, a person with dyslexia tends to reverse or misread letters or words, such as confusing the letter "b" for "d" or reading the number "6" as "9." He or she may read the word "was" as "saw" or may switch the order of words in a sentence, such as "are there" instead of "there are."

Because of these difficulties, a person with dyslexia usually reads slowly and tends to hesitate more often than expected.

Dyslexia is not a vision problem. The eyes do not see words incorrectly, but the brain apparently has difficulty processing the visual information.

It is important to note that many young children reverse letters and numbers, misread words or misunderstand words as a normal part of learning to read. Children with dyslexia, however, continue to do so after their peers have stopped, usually by first or second grade. Dyslexia may not be recognized until a child starts school, when a student of normal intelligence begins to fall behind his or her classmates in academic performance.
