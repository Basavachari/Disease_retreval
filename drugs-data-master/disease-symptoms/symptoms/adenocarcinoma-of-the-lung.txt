Symptoms

Many people with adenocarcinoma of the lung or other types of lung have no symptoms. It may be detected on chest x-ray or CT scan that is performed for screening or some other medical reason.

All lung cancers, including adenocarcinoma, have similar symptoms. They include

a cough that doesn't go away
coughing up blood or mucus
wheezing
shortness of breath
trouble breathing
chest pain
fever
discomfort when swallowing
hoarseness
weight loss
poor appetite.


If the cancer has spread beyond the lungs, it can cause other symptoms. For example, you may have bone pain if it has spread to your bones.

Many of these symptoms can be caused by other conditions. See your doctor if you have symptoms so that the problem can be diagnosed and properly treated.
