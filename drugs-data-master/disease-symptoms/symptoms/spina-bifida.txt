Symptoms

The symptoms of spinal bifida can range from mild or severe depending on the severity of the condition itself. In myelomeningocele, the child may have muscle weakness or paralysis below the level of the incompletely closed spinal column, because nerves traveling to the rest of the body from the spinal cord do not function properly. Loss of sensation and an inability to control bladder or bowel function are common. Additionally, cerebrospinal fluid may build up in the brain, leading to a condition called hydrocephalus, which is common in children with myelomeningocele. If left untreated, hydrocephalus can cause brain damage, blindness or seizures.


In addition to physical problems, spina bifida can produce learning problems, including difficulty with the following:

Paying attention and expressing or understanding spoken language 
Reading and mathematical concepts 
Organizing or sequencing information

Additional birth defects often accompany spina bifida, including abnormal brain development (called Chiari II malformation), cleft lip or palate, heart malformations, and abnormal genitourinary tract development. Other conditions that may occur more often in those with spina bifida than in those without neural tube defects include latex allergy (perhaps related to the multiple surgeries required early in life), obesity, skin problems, depression and gastrointestinal disorders.  Spina bifida is also associated with scoliosis, perhaps as a complication of muscle paralysis or abnormalities within the spinal cord.
