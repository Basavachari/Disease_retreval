Symptoms

People with Raynaud's see and feel changes in their fingers and toes when exposed to cold. The skin blanches, or turns white, then blue. Fingers and toes can tingle or feel numb.

When rewarmed, the skin flushes pink or red. And there can be throbbing or soreness as the blood surges back into the tiny blood vessels.

People with secondary Raynaud's often have symptoms related to their underlying rheumatic disease such as:

Arthritis


Rash


A thickening or hardening of the skin
