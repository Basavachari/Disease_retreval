Symptoms

In generalized anxiety disorder, the person has persistent worry or anxiety that lasts for at least several months. (The diagnostic manual in psychiatry sets the minimum to 6 months, but you don't need to use a precise timer to seek help.)

Worry or anxiety is excessive, troubling and hard to control. It often interferes with the ability to function at home, at work or in social situations.

Feeling restless or keyed up Here are some of the other defining symptoms or behaviors common in the disorder:

Having tense muscles 
Having difficulty concentrating or remembering (your mind goes blank) 
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, or not feeling rested after sleep 
Avoiding activities that could turn out badly (avoiding even small risks) 
Spending excessive effort preparing for events that could have a negative outcome 
Procrastinating or having trouble making decisions 
Worrying that leads to repeatedly asking for reassurance

People with generalized anxiety disorder also may have physical symptoms that feel like symptoms of heart disease, respiratory illness, digestive diseases and other medical illnesses.
