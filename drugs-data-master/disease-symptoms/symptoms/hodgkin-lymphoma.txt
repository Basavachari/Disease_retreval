Symptoms

The most common early symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a swollen lymph node. It is often felt as a painless lump in the neck, armpit, or groin.

Other symptoms include:

Persistent fever
Feeling very tired and weak
Weight loss
Night sweats
Itchy skin
Cough or trouble breathing
Pain in the lymph nodes after drinking alcohol

In most cases, these symptoms are not caused by cancer. However, it is important to see a doctor if you or your child experiences any of them for more than two weeks.

Hodgkin's disease is different from another common form of lymphoma, called non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The two diseases share some similarities, but there are many differences in the response to treatments. This makes the distinction between the two diseases very important.
