Symptoms

When a toenail develops a fungal infection, it typically turns yellow or brown. It becomes thick and overgrown. Foul-smelling debris also may accumulate under the nail.

As the infection continues, the nail may crumble gradually and fall off.  Or, it may become so thick that the affected toe feels uncomfortable or painful inside shoes.

A less common variety of toenail fungus is called white superficial onychomycosis. The nail turns white rather than yellow or brown. The surface becomes soft, dry and powdery.
