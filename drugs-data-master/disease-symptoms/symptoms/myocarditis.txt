Symptoms

The symptoms of myocarditis depend on the cause and severity. For example, many people with uncomplicated myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus don't have any symptoms. The only sign of heart inflammation may be a temporary abnormal result on an electrocardiogram (EKG), a test that measures the heart's electrical activity. Or an echocardiogram may show some abnormalities, such as decreased strength of heart contractions. Other people have fever, chest pain, cardiac arrhythmias (abnormally fast, slow or irregular heartbeats), sudden loss of consciousness (syncope) or signs of heart failure (shortness of breath, leg swelling).
