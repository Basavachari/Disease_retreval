Symptoms of oral cancer include:

a mouth sore that doesn't heal


an area in your mouth that becomes discolored and stays that way


a lump or thickening in your cheek that doesn't go away


a sore throat that doesn't go away


voice changes


trouble chewing or swallowing


trouble moving your jaw or tongue


loose teeth


numbness in your tongue or another part of your mouth


pain around your teeth or in your jaw


pain or irritation in the mouth that doesn't go away


unexplained weight loss

Most often these symptoms are caused by other, less serious medical problems. But if any symptoms last for two weeks or longer, see your doctor.
