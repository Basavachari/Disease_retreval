Symptoms

A person can have chronic otitis media caused by a persistent hole in the eardrum for years with no symptoms or only mild hearing loss. There may be mild ear pain or discomfort. When the middle ear is infected, fluid will drain from the ear and hearing loss can worsen.

Symptoms that can be a sign of a more serious condition, and that require immediate attention, include:

Severe pain, dizziness and facial nerve injury (facial weakness) 
Swelling, tenderness and redness behind the ear, which may indicate spread of infection to the mastoid bone (mastoiditis) 
Fever, headache and confusion
