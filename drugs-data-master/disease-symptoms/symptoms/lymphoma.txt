Symptoms

The main symptom of both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas is swollen lymph nodes in the neck, under the arms, or in the groin. Other symptoms include:

fever 
night sweats 
extreme fatigue 
unexplained weight loss

Because swollen lymph nodes caused by lymphoma usually are painless, they may get larger over a long time before the person notices. Also, fever may come and go for several weeks. Even the unexplained weight loss may continue for months before the person sees a doctor.
