Symptoms

Dry eye syndrome can cause:

Burning or itchy eyes
A feeling of something gritty, like sand, in the eyes
Sensitivity to light
Difficulty wearing contact lenses
Excessive tearing


Excessive tearing may seem to be an unusual symptom for dry eye syndrome. But these are called irritant tears, and are produced as a reflex reaction to the syndrome. They contain more water than normal tears, which have a balance of water, fat and mucus. Therefore, the excess tears just run off the eyes and cannot lubricate them as well as healthy tears do.
