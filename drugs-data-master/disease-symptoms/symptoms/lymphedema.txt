Symptoms

Lymphedema causes swelling with a feeling of heaviness, tightness or fullness, usually in an arm or leg. In most cases, only one arm or leg is affected. Swelling in the leg usually begins at the foot, and then moves up if it worsens to include the ankle, calf and knee. Additional symptoms can include:

A dull ache in the affected limb  
A feeling of tightness in the skin of the affected limb  
Difficulty moving a limb or bending at a joint because of swelling and skin tightness  
Shoes, rings or watches that suddenly feel too tight

Lymphedema can make it easier to develop a skin infection. Signs of infection include fever, pain, heat and redness. If lymphedema becomes chronic (long lasting), the skin in the affected area often becomes thickened and hard.
