Symptoms

Some pregnant women with gestational diabetes have the symptoms of diabetes that are associated with high blood glucose (hyperglycemia). These include:

Increased thirst
More frequent urination
Weight loss despite increased appetite
Fatigue
Nausea or vomiting
Yeast infections
Blurred vision

However, some women have no recognizable symptoms. This is why screening tests for this disease are recommended for all pregnant women.
