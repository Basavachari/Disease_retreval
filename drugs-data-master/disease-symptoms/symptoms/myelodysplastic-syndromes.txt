Symptoms

Many people with MDS have no symptoms. It's often diagnosed after a person has a complete blood count (CBC) for some other reason. Most often the first sign is a low red blood cell count (anemia).

MDS can cause fatigue, fevers, weight loss, and other symptoms. However, these problems can often be signs of other blood-related illnesses. Consult your doctor if you experience:

shortness of breath


weakness or feeling tired


unusually pale skin


easy bruising or bleeding


flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding


fever


frequent infections.

The symptoms of MDS depend on which blood cell type is involved and on their levels in your blood. People with a low red cell count may look pale. They may also feel weak, tired, or short of breath. People with a reduced white blood cell count are more prone to bacterial infections and high fevers. People with a low platelet count tend to bruise and bleed easily.
