Symptoms

Tics are involuntary and usually sudden, rapid and repetitive. They appear in a variety of forms. No two people with Tourette syndrome have the same symptoms.

Tics become worse with anxiety, excitement, anger or fatigue and can get better during absorbing activities or sleep. Some people with TS describe an urge or warning sign before a tic. They may be able to suppress tics briefly.

Tics can be either simple or complex.

Simple motor tics. These tics involve just one muscle group. Examples are an eye blink, a head jerk or a shoulder shrug.
Complex motor tics. These tics use more muscles groups. The face or body may contort. The person may touch someone, sniff, jump or gesture.

Sometimes a person will make a voluntary movement to cover up the tic, for example, a head thrust followed by smoothing the hair. Simple vocal tics include such sounds as grunting, barking, yelping and throat clearing.

During complex vocal tics, a person with TS may repeat his or her own words or repeat another person's words. Obscene or socially inappropriate words or behaviors may be part of a tic, which may be quite upsetting, but this probably occurs in no more than 10% of cases.
