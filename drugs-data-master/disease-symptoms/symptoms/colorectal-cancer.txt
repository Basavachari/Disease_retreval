Symptoms

Polyps and early colorectal cancer generally don't cause symptoms. As a result, they are usually caught during screening.

More advanced cancer can cause:

More or less frequent bowel movements than usual
Diarrhea or constipation
Blood in the stool (bright red, black or very dark)
Narrowed stools (about the thickness of a pencil)
Bloating, fullness or stomach cramps
Frequent gas pains
A feeling that the bowel does not empty completely
Weight loss without dieting
Continuing fatigue
