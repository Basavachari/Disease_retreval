Symptoms

Atrial fibrillation often doesn't cause any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include:

Palpitations (awareness of a rapid heartbeat)
Fainting
Dizziness
Weakness
Shortness of breath
Chest pain

Some people with atrial fibrillation have periods of normal heartbeats: the atrial fibrillation comes and goes. In many others, the atrial fibrillation becomes a constant condition, one that remains for the rest of their lives.
