Symptoms
Symptoms of conjunctivitis include:
Red, watery eyesEye discomfort (feeling "itchy" or "scratchy")A discharge from the eyes that may form crusts around the eyelashes

If it's viral conjunctivitis, this eye discharge tends to be thin, clear and watery. The eye discharge from bacterial conjunctivitis it is often thick, discolored (yellow or greenish), cloudy and sticky. Sometimes, the discharge is so sticky that the eyelids stick to one another. This is most likely to happen after waking up from sleep. With allergic conjunctivitis, both eyes usually are involved, itching is more intense and the eyes may swell.
If you wear contact lenses, you are more likely to develop severe conjunctivitis, which can damage the eye. Stop wearing contact lenses if you develop a red eye. Contact your primary care doctor or an eye doctor immediately if you have any pain.
