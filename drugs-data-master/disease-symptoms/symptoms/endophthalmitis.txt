Symptoms


The most common symptoms are loss of vision and pain. Additional symptoms vary. They depend on what caused the eye infection:

Postoperative endophthalmitis. The most common cause of this condition is a bacterial infection after cataract surgery. This serious problem can lead to permanent loss of vision.  Symptoms vary slightly. They depend on whether the infection occurs early (six weeks or less) or late (months or years) after surgery.  

 Early symptoms can include: 
  A dramatic decrease in vision in the affected eye Eye pain that worsens after surgery Red eyes  Swollen eyelids  Late symptoms tend to be milder than early symptoms. They may include: 
  Blurred vision Increased sensitivity to bright light   Mild eye pain 
Posttraumatic endophthalmitis. Symptoms caused by a penetrating eye injury are generally dramatic: 
 A dramatic decrease in vision in the affected eye Eye pain that becomes worse Red eyes  Swollen eyelids 
Hematogenous endophthalmitis. This is when an infection spreads through the bloodstream and settles in the eye. Symptoms may develop gradually and be fairly subtle. For example: 
 A mild decrease in vision over a period of a few weeks The appearance of floaters. These are dark, semi-transparent, floating shapes in the field of vision.
