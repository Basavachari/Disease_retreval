Symptoms

Common symptoms of lactose intolerance include:

Watery, bulky, odd-smelling stools 
Nausea 
Abdominal pain 
Cramps 
Bloating

Flatulence that begins about 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating or drinking foods or drinks containing lactose.

The severity of symptoms varies, depending on the amount of lactose an individual can tolerate, the amount of lactose ingested, and the size and fat content of the meal. People who also have irritable bowel syndrome tend to have more severe symptoms from lactose intolerance.
