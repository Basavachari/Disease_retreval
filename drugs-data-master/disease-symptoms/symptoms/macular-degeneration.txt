Symptoms

Dry AMD sometimes does not cause any symptoms. Or, it can make central vision a little less clear. In a small number of cases, it gradually causes more significant blurring or loss of vision in the center of the visual field. In these more advanced cases, faces and printed words become hard to recognize.

As a first symptom of wet AMD, straight lines or edges appear crooked. Images become blurred. In some cases, this is followed by a central blind spot, as in dry AMD. However, unlike in dry AMD, this vision loss usually develops rapidly.

AMD generally does not affect side vision, even in advanced cases. Most patients can continue to function independently.

People who have AMD appear to see normally. But they may actually have difficulty recognizing friends. This can lead to social difficulties.

Some people with vision loss from AMD experience visual hallucinations. That is, they see things, such as people and patterns, that are not there.
