Symptoms

The first symptom of RP is usually diminished night vision. It becomes more difficult to see in dimly lit or dark places.

People with RP also slowly lose peripheral (side) vision and visual sharpness.


Over time, the disorder leads to tunnel vision. The outer edges of vision are dark, leaving a shrinking circle of vision in the center.

Eventually, people with RP can go blind. But most people with this disorder retain some vision, even in old age.
