Symptoms

Cataracts typically do not cause any symptoms until they have grown large enough to interfere significantly with vision. Once symptoms of cataracts develop, they can include:

Cloudy or blurry vision
Double vision (diplopia)
Colors appear faded
Seeing halos around lights
Increased sensitivity to glare
