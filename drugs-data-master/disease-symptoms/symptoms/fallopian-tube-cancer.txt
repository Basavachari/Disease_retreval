Symptoms

Symptoms of fallopian tube cancer can include

abnormal vaginal bleeding, especially after menopause
abdominal pain or a feeling of pressure in the abdomen
abnormal vaginal discharge (white, clear, or pinkish)
an abdominal or pelvic mass.


Having these symptoms doesn't mean you have fallopian tube cancer. These symptoms can be caused by other problems.
