Symptoms

Many people with bladder cancer have no symptoms. Instead, the diagnosis is made when red blood cells are detected in a urine sample. However, people with bladder cancer often don't see blood in their urine. There is not enough blood to change the urine color. This is called microscopic hematuria.

When symptoms of bladder cancer do occur, they include:

Red or rust colored urine caused by the presence of many red blood cells (called macroscopic hematuria)
Painful urination or burning when urinating
More frequent urination than normal
