Symptoms

The primary symptoms of myasthenia gravis are that muscles are weak and tire quickly. These symptoms can take many forms, and the symptoms may be more or less severe for different people. Symptoms may include some or all of the following:

Muscles that become progressively weaker with prolonged use  
Muscle weakness that seems better in the morning or after resting and worse after activity or at the end of the day  
Drooping eyelids  
Blurred or double vision  
A change in facial expressions, such as a smile that looks more like a grimace  
Jaw muscles that tire easily, such as when chewing gum or meat  
Difficulty swallowing  
Slurred or impaired speech  
Weakness in arms, legs, fingers, hands or neck  
Shortness of breath

Sudden, severe weakness (myasthenic crisis) may develop without warning, sometimes triggered by an infection or other stress, causing breathing and swallowing problems. Ocular myasthenia gravis is limited to the eye while generalized myasthenia gravis may affect muscles throughout the body.
