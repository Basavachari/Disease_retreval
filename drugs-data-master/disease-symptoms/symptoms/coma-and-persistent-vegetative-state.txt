Symptoms

A person in a coma will be unconscious and unable to communicate. He or she will not respond to light, sound or pain. The person may stretch his or her arms and legs in unusual ways, but the person will not display purposeful movement. In a deep coma, the areas of the brain that control breathing may be affected, and the person may need to be kept alive by an artificial respirator (a mechanical breathing machine).

A person in a persistent vegetative state will be able to breathe without assistance. He or she will have cycles of being awake and asleep. During the awake cycles, the person may react to physical pain and may move, but the movement will not be purposeful.
