Symptoms

Spinal cord tumors generally develop slowly and worsen over time. They can cause many symptoms depending upon their location. Symptoms arise as the tumor presses on the spinal cord or the nerves that exit it. Tumors also may restrict the flow of blood to the spinal cord. Common symptoms include:

Pain. Back pain is usually the most prominent symptom, but pressure on the spinal cord can trigger pain that feels as if it is coming from various parts of the body. This pain is sometimes severe, is often constant and can have an aching or burning quality.
Sensory changes. These can take the form of numbness, tingling, decreased sensitivity to temperature or cold sensations.
Motor problems. Tumors that hinder nerve communication can cause muscle-related symptoms, such as progressive muscle weakness or loss of control over the bowel or bladder.

The part of the body affected by the symptoms will vary depending on the tumor's location on the spinal cord. In general, symptoms occur in parts of the body that are at the same level as or lower than the tumor.
