Symptoms

Symptoms and their severity can vary. Some symptoms come from inflammation in the intestines. Other symptoms come from a lack of nutrients, due to the failure of your intestine to digest food properly.

Children generally develop symptoms only after they start eating foods that contain gluten. Common symptoms include:

Upset stomach  
Failure to grow normally (often called "failure to thrive") or delayed growth  
Weight loss  
Painful abdominal bloating or distention  
Pale, foul-smelling, greasy stools  
Chronic (long-lasting) or recurring diarrhea  
Irritability
