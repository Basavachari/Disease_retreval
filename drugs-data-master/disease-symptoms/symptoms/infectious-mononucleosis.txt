The first symptoms of mononucleosis typically include:

Fever


Headaches

Unusual fatigue, such as the need for 12 to 16 hours of sleep daily


These symptoms are followed very shortly by:

Sore throat


Enlarged lymph nodes


Chills


Joint aches


Loss of appetite and slight weight loss


Nausea and vomiting (occasionally)


A red rash, usually on the chest. This is more likely if the person has recently taken the antibiotics ampicillin or amoxicillin.


Abdominal pain


Enlarged spleen

Rare symptoms include:

In rare cases, an enlarged spleen can rupture. The spleen is a small organ near the stomach. Untreated, a ruptured spleen can cause life-threatening internal bleeding.
