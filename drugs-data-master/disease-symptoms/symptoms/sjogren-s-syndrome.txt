Symptoms

Some people experience only minor symptoms. Others have blurred vision, eye discomfort, recurring mouth infections, swollen salivary glands and difficulty swallowing or eating. Sjögren's syndrome also can affect the lungs, joints, vagina, pancreas, kidneys, skin and brain.

Symptoms include eye pain, irritation, or redness, and dry mouth. The eyes can feel dry and sandy. Many people with this condition also have vaginal dryness, joint pain and stiffness, muscle aches, dry, cracked tongue and enlarged lymph glands. Other symptoms depend on what other parts of the body are affected. For example, shortness of breath may develop because of lung inflammation and scarring.
