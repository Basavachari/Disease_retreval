Symptoms

A person with ankylosing spondylitis commonly will feel pain or stiffness in the lower back. The symptoms are typically worse in the morning or after periods of inactivity and improve with activity or exercise. People who have this disorder may feel worse if they do not exercise regularly. (Back pain from many other causes tends to worsen with exercise.)

Usually, back pain begins in the sacroiliac joint and works its way up the lower spine. Eventually, the disorder can affect the entire spine. People can have pain and tenderness in the thighs, hips and other joints of the torso. Other joints, such as knees and ankles, can be inflamed as well, although it usually affects no more than three or four joints in the arms and legs.

As the spine and its supporting structures stiffen, a person may begin to stoop over. With time, bones of the spine can fuse or grow together, causing an extremely stiff, rigid backbone called a poker spine. This may make it difficult to take a deep breath because the rigid spine and stiff joints between the ribs and breastbone make it difficult for the chest to expand. The pain and rigidity in the lower back can cause problems walking. Almost any movement can become painful.

In rare cases, inflammation in the lungs causes shortness of breath and inflammation in the eyes may cause reduced vision with red, painful eyes.

Other possible symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis include:

Fatigue  
Fever  
Loss of appetite  
Weight loss
