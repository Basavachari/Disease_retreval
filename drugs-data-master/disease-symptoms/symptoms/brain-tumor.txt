Symptoms

The symptoms of a brain tumor often are the same as those of other diseases and may develop gradually. That's why they may be overlooked for a long time before diagnosis.

Although a brain tumor rarely causes headaches, someone with no history of headaches who develops them should be seen by a doctor. Headaches from a brain tumor tend to be worse upon waking and ease during the day. Other symptoms may include

vomiting and nausea  
new onset of seizures  
weakness involving one side of the body, such as an arm and leg on the same side  
trouble talking or change in speech  
loss of coordination  
changes in vision or abnormal eye movements 
memory or personality changes  
ringing and hearing loss in one ear


The symptoms noted above are not specific for brain tumor. In fact, most often any of these symptoms are related to some other cause.

The specific symptoms of a brain tumor depend on its size and location. They can be caused by several factors, including

increased pressure in the skull  
damage to vital tissue  
swelling and fluid buildup  
hydrocephalus, sometimes called "water on the brain," which results when the flow of cerebrospinal fluid is blocked and builds up in the brain
