Symptoms

Marfan syndrome affects each person differently, and the presence and severity of symptoms can vary. Most often, people with Marfan become aware of the disorder after they find out that someone else in their family has it or because of their appearance. People with Marfan syndrome typically are tall with long, thin extremities, with or without other skeletal changes.

Vision problems, including nearsightedness and ectopia lentis, usually develop. The symptoms, such as chest pain and shortness of breath, can be very dramatic if there is expansion of an aortic aneurysm or heart valve damage.
