Symptoms

Simple Bladder Infection
A bladder infection causes inflammation (irritation and swelling) of the bladder and urethra. This causes the sudden development of a predictable group of symptoms. Many women who have had a bladder infection in the past can identify the symptoms easily when they develop another infection. These symptoms usually include one or more of the following:

The need to urinate more often than normal, although only small amounts of urine are passed each time
A sudden need to urinate
Pain, burning or other discomfort during urination
The need to urinate at night
Pain in the lower abdomen
Blood in the urine
Urine that is cloudy, has an unpleasant odor or smells unusually strong

A bladder infection in a young child may cause new episodes of bedwetting as the only symptom.

Complicated Bladder Infection
People with complicated bladder infections usually have symptoms similar to those with simple infections. However, patients may also develop additional symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, flank pain, back pain, or confusion if the bacteria spread from the urinary system to the blood stream or kidney.

Complicated bladder infections require longer treatment than simple infections. Further testing may also be needed to look at the structure or function of the urinary system.
