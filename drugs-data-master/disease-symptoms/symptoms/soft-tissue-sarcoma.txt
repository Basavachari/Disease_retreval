Symptoms

In most cases, someone with soft tissue sarcoma will have a lump in some part of the body, usually an arm, a leg or the trunk. The lump may be painful. In physically active people, the lump can be mistaken for a sports-related injury.

Rhabdomyosarcoma that does not affect the arms and legs can cause a painless lump in the head or neck. Or it can cause other symptoms that reflect the tumor's location. For example, rhabdomyosarcoma

in the eye or eyelid can cause a bulging eye, a swollen eyelid, or paralysis of the eye muscles
in the sinuses can cause a stuffy or blocked nose; any nasal discharge can contain pus or blood
in the skull can erode the bones that protect the brain, triggering headache and nausea
in the urinary tract and reproductive organs can cause difficulty urinating and blood in the urine. Other symptoms include constipation, a lump inside the vagina, vaginal discharge that contains blood and mucus, and a painless enlargement of one side of the scrotum, affecting the testicle.
