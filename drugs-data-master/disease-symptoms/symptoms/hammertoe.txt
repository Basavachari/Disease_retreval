Symptoms

The symptoms of hammertoe include:

A curling toe 
Pain or discomfort in the toes and ball of the foot or the front of the leg, especially when toes are stretched downward 
Thickening of the skin above or below the affected toe with the formation of corns or calluses 
Difficulty finding shoes that fit well 
In its early stages, hammertoe is not obvious. Frequently, hammertoe does not cause any symptoms except for the claw-like toe shape.
