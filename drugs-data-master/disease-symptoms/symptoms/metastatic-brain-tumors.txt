Symptoms

The signs and symptoms of secondary brain tumors depend on their size and location. This is because different parts of the brain control different functions.

As a tumor grows, it can press against or destroy normal brain tissue. It can also increase pressure inside the skull.

Signs and symptoms of brain metastases include

headaches
seizures
visual changes, such as double vision
lack of energy and/or sleepiness
vomiting
changes in mood, behavior, or personality
weakness in parts of the body
trouble speaking or hearing
problems with memory or mental ability
loss of balance or coordination.

These symptoms are not necessarily signs of brain metastases. But it is important to contact your doctor if you experience any of them.

Some people with metastatic brain tumors don't show any symptoms. However, over time, the brain metastases will continue to grow, eventually causing symptoms.
