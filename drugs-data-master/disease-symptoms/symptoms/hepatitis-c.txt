Symptoms

Many people with hepatitis C do not have any symptoms.

Some people develop symptoms that last for up to 3 months. These symptoms include:

A general sick feeling
A yellowish discoloration of the skin
Weakness
Poor appetite
Fatigue
Nausea
Abdominal pain

Some people with acute hepatitis C completely eliminate the virus from their bodies. They don’t suffer any long-term consequences.


But the majority of people with acute hepatitis C remain infected. They develop chronic hepatitis C.

Only some people with long-term hepatitis C develop symptoms. These symptoms include:

Weight loss
Poor appetite
Fatigue
Aching joints

Most people with chronic hepatitis C do not have any symptoms for 20 to 30 years. All the while, however, the virus slowly damages their livers. Unless they are tested for hepatitis C, many of these people do not know that they are infected. That is, until they develop the symptoms of advanced liver disease.
