Symptoms

Symptoms of hay fever usually begin before age 30. They typically include:

Sneezing
Itchy and runny nose
Stuffy nose
Red, itchy or watery eyes
Itchy or sore throat

The congested nose can lead to mouth breathing, and the dripping mucus can cause persistent cough and sore throat. Because hay fever also causes swelling in the sinuses and near the opening of the Eustachian tube (passage that connects the throat to the middle ear), sufferers can develop additional symptoms of secondary sinus infections or ear infections.
