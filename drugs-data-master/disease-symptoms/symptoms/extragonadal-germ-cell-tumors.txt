Symptoms

Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor:

Mid-chest —EGCTs here can cause chest pain, breathing problems, a cough, weight loss, nausea and fever. Patients may also have bulging veins on their chest and neck. These tumors are most often diagnosed in men in their 20s.
Lower back —EGCTs here usually appear as a mass in the lower abdomen or buttocks. They are more commonly diagnosed in infants or young children than in adults. The mass may cause difficulty in walking, urinating, or having a bowel movement.
Back of the abdomen — EGCTs in the back of the abdomen may cause back pain or kidney problems. (The mass can put pressure on the tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder.) Sometimes, the abdominal mass can be felt during a physical exam.
Brain (pineal gland) —Germ cell tumors can press on parts of the brain and interfere with the flow of fluid around the brain and spinal cord. This can cause

A child with a tumor that produces hormones may show signs of puberty earlier than normal. Almost all pineal germ cell tumors, which are very rare, occur in people younger than 40.
