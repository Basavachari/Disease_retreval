Symptoms

Very small kidney stones may pass out of the body in the urine without causing symptoms.

Larger stones may become trapped in the narrow ureter. This can cause:

Severe pain in the back or side 
Nausea and vomiting 
Blood in the urine (urine may look pink, red, or brown)

The location of pain may shift downward, closer to the groin. This usually indicates that the stone has traveled downward in the ureter and is now closer to the bladder. As the stone approaches the bladder, you may feel:

A stronger urge to urinate  
A burning sensation when urinating

When stones pass out of your body in your urine, you may see the stones exit.
