Symptoms

A panic attack is defined by having at least four of the following symptoms:

Palpitations, heart pounding or a rapid pulse 
Sweating 
Trembling or shaking 
Breathing problems, such as shortness of breath or feeling smothered 
Feeling of choking 
Chest pain or chest discomfort



Abdominal discomfort, upset stomach or nausea 


Feeling faint, dizzy, light-headed or unsteady on your feet 


Feeling unreal or detached from yourself 


Fear of losing control  


Fear of dying 


Numbness or tingling in arms, legs or other parts of the body 


Chills or hot flushes


Between panic attacks, someone with panic disorder usually has persistent worries that a new attack will occur. These worries may cause the person to dramatically change his or her behavior or lifestyle to avoid the embarrassment of "losing control" while with other people.
