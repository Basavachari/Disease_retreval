Symptoms

Different areas of the brain are responsible for different functions. These include sensation, movement, sight, speech, balance, and coordination.

The symptoms of stroke vary depending on which area of the brain is damaged. Symptoms can include:

Headache, with or without vomiting


Dizziness or confusion


Weakness or paralysis on one side of the body


Sudden, severe numbness in any part of the body


Visual disturbance, including sudden loss of vision


Difficulty walking, including staggering or veering


Coordination problems in the arms and hands


Slurred speech or inability to speak


Sudden deviation of the eyes toward one direction


Seizures


Irregular breathing


Stupor


Coma

The sudden appearance of one or more of these symptoms is a warning sign that a stroke may be in progress.

In some cases, strokes are preceded by one or more transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). TIAs are brief episodes of stroke-like symptoms. Most often the symptoms last for only 5 to 20 minutes, with no permanent brain damage.
