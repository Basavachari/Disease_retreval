Symptoms

Symptoms usually do not appear until the disease is advanced. Symptoms can include:

Unexplained weight loss


Loss of appetite


Feeling full after a small meal


Pain or swelling, especially in the upper-right abdomen


A yellow tint in the skin and eyes


Liver enlargement or a mass in the area of the liver


Low blood sugar

Liver cancer can lead to high pressure in blood vessels that feed into the liver. This can cause veins in the esophagus and stomach to swell with significant risk of bleeding and vomiting blood.
