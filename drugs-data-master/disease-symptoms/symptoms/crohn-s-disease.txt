Symptoms

Some people with Crohn's disease have only occasional cramps, or diarrhea. Their symptoms are so mild they do not seek medical attention.

However, most people with Crohn's disease have more bothersome symptoms. They may experience long stretches of time with no symptoms. But these are interrupted by flare-ups of symptoms.

When Crohn's disease first begins, or during a flare-up, you might experience:

Abdominal pain, usually at or below the navel. It is typically worse after meals.
Diarrhea that may contain blood
Sores around the anus
Drainage of pus or mucus from the anus or anal area
Pain when you have a bowel movement
Mouth sores
Loss of appetite
Joint pains or back pain
Pain or vision changes in one or both eyes
Weight loss despite eating a normal-calorie diet
Fever
Weakness or fatigue
Stunted growth and delayed puberty in children
