Symptoms

Hydatidiform moles can exaggerate the usual symptoms of pregnancy. Many of the symptoms are similar to those associated with miscarriage, and most women with molar pregnancies first believe they have miscarried. Invasive moles and choriocarcinomas can cause symptoms during or after pregnancy, and symptoms can develop after a hydatidiform mole has been removed.

The most common symptom is vaginal bleeding, especially between the 6th and 16th weeks of pregnancy. Another symptom is bleeding that continues for a long time after delivery. Small amounts of bleeding can show up as a watery brown discharge from the vagina. Sometimes, a piece of tissue containing grapelike shapes will pass through the vagina, though this is not common. It is important to remember that most vaginal bleeding during or after pregnancy is not associated with a molar pregnancy. However, you should report any bleeding during pregnancy to your health care professional.

A mole or choriocarcinoma also can cause the following symptoms:

Abdominal swelling, caused by the uterus becoming larger, that occurs more rapidly than expected for the first trimester of pregnancy
Excessive vomiting during pregnancy
Fatigue, often caused by anemia from heavy bleeding
Sudden severe abdominal pain caused by internal bleeding
Pelvic cramping or vaginal discharge
Shortness of breath, coughing or blood in coughed-up secretions because choriocarcinoma very rarely spreads to the lungs before it is diagnosed.

There are many other causes for these symptoms — most are associated with normal pregnancies — so if you have such problems don't assume you have a molar pregnancy. Always speak with your health care professional.
