Symptoms

Symptoms related to MODY tend to develop gradually. This is similar to what happens to people with type 2 diabetes. In comparison, the symptoms of type 1 diabetes often occur rather quickly over a few weeks.

Early symptoms of MODY may include blurry vision, recurrent skin infections, or yeast infections. But there may be no symptoms at all. People with MODY often have high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) for many years before they have any symptoms. The increased blood sugar develops gradually, and may only be noticed if a doctor does a blood sugar test during a checkup.

Without treatment, blood sugars will continue to rise, causing:

Frequent urination


Increased thirst


Weight loss.

MODY 5, one of the rare types of MODY, can involve other organs in addition to the pancreas. The kidneys sometimes become damaged before diabetes is diagnosed. Kidney damage could lead to a decrease in urine production, rather than the increased urination normally seen with diabetes.
