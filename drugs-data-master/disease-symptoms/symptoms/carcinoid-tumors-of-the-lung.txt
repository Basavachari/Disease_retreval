Symptoms

Sometimes, carcinoid tumors of the lungs don't produce any symptoms; often, they are detected when a chest x-ray is taken for another condition. But if you do have symptoms, their severity depends on the size of the tumor and whether it produces abnormal hormones. Carcinoids arising from the gastrointestinal tract may be found incidentally when patients are being evaluated for other conditions or can result in some bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. Potential symptoms include

a persistent cough
coughing up blood
shortness of breath or wheezing
pneumonia (a lung infection)
facial flushing
diarrhea
a fast heartbeat
weight gain
increased facial and body hair.

Carcinoids arising from the gastrointestinal tract may be found incidentally when patients are being evaluated or treated for other conditions. For example, a carcinoid tumor might be found when a person's appendix is surgically removed because of appendicitis. Rarely a gastrointestinal carcinoid can cause internal bleeding.
