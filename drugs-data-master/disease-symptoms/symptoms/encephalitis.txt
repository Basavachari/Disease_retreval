Symptoms

The symptoms of encephalitis range from mild to severe and can be life threatening. Fortunately, most cases are not severe. Possible symptoms, beginning with the two most common, include the following:

Sudden fever
Headache
Confusion, which can be mild at first
Vomiting
Stiff neck and back
Drowsiness
Extreme sensitivity to light
Seizures

Many of these symptoms also occur in other conditions that affect the brain, including migraine headaches and life-threatening conditions such as bleeding in the brain. When a person has a fever along with the other symptoms, some kind of infection is most likely.
