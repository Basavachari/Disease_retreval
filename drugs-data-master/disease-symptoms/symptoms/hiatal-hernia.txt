Symptoms

Sliding hiatal hernias may not cause any symptoms, or they may cause heartburn that is worse when you lean forward, strain or lie down. There may be chronic belching and, sometimes, regurgitation (backflow of stomach contents into the throat).

In some cases, a paraesophageal hernia may slide into the chest and become trapped (incarcerated) and unable to slide back into the abdomen. If this happens, there is a danger that the trapped hernia may die because its blood supply is cut off (strangulated). Symptoms of a strangulated hiatal hernia include sudden severe chest pain and difficulty swallowing. This situation requires immediate medical treatment.

Occasionally a hiatal hernia can cause anemia from bleeding. This can occur if the wall of the stomach becomes raw from rubbing against the edges of the diaphragm hiatus.
