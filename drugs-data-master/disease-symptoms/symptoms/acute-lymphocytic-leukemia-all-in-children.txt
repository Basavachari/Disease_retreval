Symptoms

The symptoms of ALL in children are similar to those in adults. They include

fever
easy bruising or bleeding
dark red spots under the skin
lumps under the arms or in the neck, stomach, or groin
difficulty breathing
bone or joint pain
weakness
fatigue
headaches
loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss.

If your child has these symptoms, it does not mean that he or she has ALL. These symptoms can be caused by other conditions. However, you should contact your child's doctor if they occur.
