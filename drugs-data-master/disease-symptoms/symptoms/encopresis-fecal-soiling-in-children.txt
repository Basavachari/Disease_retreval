Symptoms

In most children with encopresis, the most obvious signs are:

Soiled underpants  
A foul body odor (the smell of stool)

Other signs and symptoms may include:

Periods of constipation (no bowel movements) alternating with very large bowel movements 


Streaks of blood on the outside of stool, or on toilet tissue used to wipe after a bowel movement 


Pain in the lower abdomen or rectum 


Stool-stained clothes hidden in closets, under the bed or elsewhere 


Bedwetting, probably related to pressure from the large chunk of stool in the rectum

In rarer cases, when encopresis is caused by serious psychological problems, a child may drop or smear stool on floors, walls or furniture.
