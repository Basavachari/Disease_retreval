Symptoms

The most prominent symptom of ME/CFS is an unexplained feeling of fatigue, which is not relieved by rest. However, many other medical conditions cause marked fatigue.

To better identify people with ME/CFS, diagnostic criteria should include these four types of symptoms:

A substantial reduction or impairment in the ability to engage in pre-illness levels of occupational, educational, social or personal activities for longer than 6 months
Post-exertional malaise (PEM), which is a worsening of symptoms following physical, mental, or emotional exertion that would not have caused a problem before the illness. PEM can last a couple days to more than a week following the bout of exertion.
Unrefreshing sleep that leaves not feeling better or perhaps even feeling worse after a full night’s sleep and no other reason for poor sleep quality.
One or both of these neurological symptoms:
 Cognitive impairment, such as problems with thinking, memory, attention, organization skills, and information processing. These symptoms are often made worse after physical exertion, prolonged standing, or mental tasks.Orthostatic intolerance, which is a worsening of symptoms upon assuming and maintaining upright posture. This can include lightheadedness, fainting, increased fatigue, cognitive worsening, headaches, or nausea with standing and often some relief with lying down.


Many people with ME/CFS also experience additional symptoms, including:

Muscle pain
Pain in the joints without swelling or redness
Headaches of a new type, pattern, or severity
Swollen or tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpit
A sore throat that is frequent or recurring
Sensitivity to light and sound
Nausea
Allergies or sensitivities to foods, odors, chemicals, or medications
