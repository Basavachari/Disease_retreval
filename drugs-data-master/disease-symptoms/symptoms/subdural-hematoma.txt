Symptoms

Acute subdural hemorrhage usually develops after severe head trauma. Injuries that result in this condition are typically forceful enough to cause a temporary loss of consciousness.

Usually, in the minutes to hours after head injury, the person recovers consciousness. Then, the person gradually loses consciousness again, this time from subdural bleeding.

Other common symptoms of an acute subdural hemorrhage include:

Severe headache 
Weakness on one side of the body 
Seizures  
Changes in vision or speech

Chronic subdural hemorrhages produce more subtle symptoms. These symptoms may continue for more than a month before the diagnosis is recognized.

These symptoms include:

Mild headache 
Nausea or vomiting 
Change in personality 
Memory loss 
Loss of balance or difficulty walking 
Double vision 
Weakness, numbness or tingling in arms or legs


The symptoms caused by chronic subdural hemorrhage can mimic other common conditions. For example, they may resemble strokes and brain tumors. Occasionally, the gradual memory loss and personality changes can be mistaken for dementia.
