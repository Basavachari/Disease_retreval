Symptoms

Some women never realize that they have fibroids because they have no symptoms. In other women, uterine fibroids are discovered either during a routine gynecologic exam or during prenatal care.

When symptoms of fibroids occur, they can include:

Pelvic pain or pressure
Heavy menstrual bleeding
Bleeding or spotting between menstrual periods
Unusually frequent urination
Abdominal swelling
Low back pain during intercourse or during menstrual periods
Fatigue or low energy from heavy periods and excessive bleeding
Infertility, if the fibroids are blocking the fallopian tubes
Constipation
Repeated miscarriages
