Symptoms

The symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage can include:

Very severe, sudden headache (Some people say the start of this headache is like a thunderclap.) 
Nausea and vomiting  
Inability to look at bright light  
Stiff neck  
Dizziness  
Confusion  
A seizure  
Loss of consciousness

If you have only a small subarachnoid hemorrhage, you may have several of these symptoms, particularly a severe headache that starts suddenly. However, your symptoms may improve on their own. This can be a critical warning sign, called a sentinel headache. People who have a small subarachnoid hemorrhage may have a second hemorrhage within the next week if they do not get medical treatment.

In the several days that follow a subarachnoid hemorrhage, it is possible to develop more typical symptoms of a stroke, from damage of specific areas of the brain. Examples of these symptoms include:

Weakness, paralysis or numbness of one side or one part of the body 
Difficulty speaking 
Difficulty walking 
Coma
