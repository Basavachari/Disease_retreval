Symptoms

Signs and symptoms vary and can include:

Large head, elongated face; large, bulging ears; prominent chin and forehead; high arched palate (roof of the mouth); flat feet; large testicles in boys (especially after puberty) 
Other physical problems, including imbalance of eye muscles (strabismus), serous otitis media (fluid in the middle ear that is not infected), unusually flexible joints, seizures and mitral valve prolapse 
Cognitive and intellectual problems, including mental retardation, learning disabilities and abnormal speech 
Behavioral problems, including hyperactivity, attention difficulties, avoidance of eye contact and other behaviors on the autism spectrum, violent outbursts (especially in teenage boys), and an unusual sensitivity to environmental stimuli such as sights, sounds, smells and touch

Fragile X tends to be milder and less obvious in females. A female normally inherits two X chromosomes, one from each parent. If one of the X chromosomes has the fragile X mutation, the other X chromosome, inherited from her unaffected parent, can partially compensate for the incorrect genetic information. About half of affected females show no symptoms of fragile X syndrome. The other half have symptoms, especially learning disabilities, behavioral problems or intellectual impairment.

In males, fragile X tends to be more obvious and more severe. A male child usually inherits only one X chromosome, from his mother. If that X chromosome has the fragile X mutation, the child most likely will have the full fragile X syndrome because the Y chromosome (inherited from his father) does not carry the genetic information that can compensate for the problem.

The pre-mutation can also increase the risk of two other disorders: fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). It is also associated with neurocognitive problems.
