Symptoms

In some cases, lung cancer is detected when a person with no symptoms has a chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan for another reason. But most people with lung cancer have one or more of these symptoms:

a cough that doesn't go away


coughing up blood or mucus


wheezing


shortness of breath


trouble breathing


chest pain


fever


discomfort when swallowing


hoarseness


weight loss


poor appetite


an irregular heartbeat if the cancer is located close to the heart.


If the cancer has spread beyond the lungs, it can cause other symptoms. For example, you may have bone pain if it has spread to your bones.

Certain small cell lung cancers may secrete chemicals that can alter the body's chemical composition. For example, levels of sodium and calcium may be abnormal. This can lead to the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.

Many of these symptoms can be caused by other conditions. See your doctor if you have symptoms so that the problem can be diagnosed and properly treated.
