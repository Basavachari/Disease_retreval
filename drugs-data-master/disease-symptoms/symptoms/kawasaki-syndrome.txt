Symptoms

Because there is no test available to confirm that a person has Kawasaki disease, doctors define the condition by the combination of problems that it produces. The typical person with this disease has a high fever (usually 104 degrees Fahrenheit or above) for at least five days. This fever usually occurs together with at least four of the following additional symptoms:

Conjunctivitis of both eyes (bloodshot eyes)  
Symptoms involving the mouth or throat, including redness and inflammation of the lips or throat, cracked lips, bleeding lips or a strawberry-colored tongue  
Symptoms affecting the hands or feet, including swelling, redness of the skin on the palms and soles or peeling skin on the fingertips, toes, palms or soles  
A rash, primarily on the torso  
Swollen glands in the neck

People with Kawasaki disease can have other symptoms that are not part of the definition of the disease. These can include:

Pain and swelling of the joints  
Diarrhea  
Vomiting  
Abdominal pain  
Cough  
Earache  
Runny nose  
Irritability  
Seizures  
Weakness in the arms or legs  
Weakness of facial muscles  
Heart rhythm abnormalities  
Signs of heart failure
