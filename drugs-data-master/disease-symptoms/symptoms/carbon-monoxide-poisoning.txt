Symptoms


Symptoms vary depending on the concentration of carbon monoxide in the environment, the length of time you are exposed, and your health. If you are exposed to very high levels of carbon monoxide gas in a poorly ventilated room, you can develop:

Headache 
Shortness of breath 
Personality changes 
Unusually emotional behavior or extreme swings in emotions 
Fatigue 
Malaise (a generally sick feeling) 
Dizziness 
Clumsiness or difficulty walking 
Vision problems 
Confusion and impaired judgment 
Nausea and vomiting 
Rapid breathing 
Chest pain 
A rapid or irregular heartbeat

Without immediate treatment, you can lose consciousness, have a seizure, enter a coma, and potentially die. Death can result from only a few minutes of exposure to higher concentrations or from an hour of exposure to lower levels.

If you are exposed to very low levels of carbon monoxide over a longer period (weeks or months), your symptoms can appear like the flu, with headache, fatigue, malaise (a general sick feeling) and sometimes nausea and vomiting. People with long-term exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide also can have numbness, unexplained vision problems, sleep disturbances, and impaired memory and concentration.
