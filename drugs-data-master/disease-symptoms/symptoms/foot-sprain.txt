Symptoms

In a mild or moderate midfoot sprain, your midfoot area will be swollen and tender, and there may be some local bruising (black and blue discoloration). In more severe sprains, you may not be able to bear weight on your injured foot.

If you have turf toe, the base of your big toe will be painful and swollen.
