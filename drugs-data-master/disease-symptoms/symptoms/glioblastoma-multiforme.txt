Symptoms

As brain tumors grow, they press against or damage nerves or other part of the brain and interfere with thought, memory, emotion, movement, vision, hearing, touch, and other brain functions. Swelling and fluid buildup can also affect brain function.

The most common symptoms of glioblastoma are:

Frequent headaches (usually worse in the morning)
Nausea and vomiting
Memory loss
Seizures
Changes in personality, mood, and ability to concentrate
Changes in speech, vision, or hearing

Many other conditions can cause these symptoms, but call your doctor promptly if you experience any of these problems.
