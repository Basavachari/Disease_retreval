Symptoms

Symptoms of a broken nose include:

Bruising, swelling and tenderness around the nose
Nosebleed
A deformed, twisted or crooked nose
Blockage of one or both nostrils
A deviated septum
A bruise-like discoloration under the eyes

Even if your nose is injured only mildly, the area can swell significantly within one to two hours after the impact. Until this swelling goes away, you or your doctor may not be able to accurately assess the extent of any damage.
