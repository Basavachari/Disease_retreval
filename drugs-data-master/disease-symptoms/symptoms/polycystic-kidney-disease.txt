Symptoms

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease

The two most common symptoms are headaches and pain in the back and the sides, between the ribs and hips. The pain may be mild or severe; it may come and go or be persistent.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can also cause

urinary tract infections 


blood in the urine (hematuria)


high blood pressure 


kidney stones

Many people live with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease for several decades before symptoms develop. For this reason, you may hear the disease referred to as "adult polycystic kidney disease."

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease often causes symptoms in babies even before they are born. For this reason, it is often called "infantile PKD." Children with this disease often experience

high blood pressure


urinary tract infections


frequent urination 


low blood cell counts


varicose veins


hemorrhoids


growth problems or smaller than average size 


kidney failure during childhood


The severity of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease varies. It can cause death in babies with the most severe forms, while other people live with it into adulthood without experiencing any symptoms.
