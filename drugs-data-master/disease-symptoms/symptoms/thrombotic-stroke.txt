Symptoms

The symptoms of a thrombotic stroke vary, depending on which area of the brain is affected. That is because different areas of the brain are responsible for different functions. For example, different areas of the brain control movement, sight, speech, balance and coordination.

Symptoms can include:

Headache  
Dizziness or confusion  
Weakness or paralysis on one side of the body  
Sudden, severe numbness in any part of the body  
Visual disturbance, including sudden loss of vision  
Difficulty walking, including staggering or veering  
Coordination problems in the arms and hands  
Slurred speech or inability to speak

If any of these symptoms appear suddenly, you may be having a thrombotic stroke or any other kind of stroke. Symptoms, once they begin, can quickly become less prominent, stay the same or gradually get worse over hours or days.

Often, brief episodes of stroke-like symptoms occur before a stroke. A short episode of stroke-like symptoms is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Symptoms appear suddenly and then get better over several minutes to a couple hours.  Most TIAs last less than 30 minutes. One or more of these attacks occurs before more than half of all strokes.
