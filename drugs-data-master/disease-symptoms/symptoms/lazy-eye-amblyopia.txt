Symptoms

Lazy eye usually does not cause any symptoms. Sometimes parents suspect vision problems because a child squints, looks cross-eyed, or holds his or her head in awkward positions to see things. In many cases, the problem is detected by a routine vision screening exam, either before or after a child starts school. The screening exam will show that the child's vision is much better in one eye than the other.
