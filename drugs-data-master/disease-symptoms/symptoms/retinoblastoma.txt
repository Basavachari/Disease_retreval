Symptoms

The most common sign of retinoblastoma is a whitish-looking pupil. However, it does not always mean the child has the disease. Children with retinoblastoma also may have a crossed eye that turns out toward the ear or in toward the nose. But again, this is a common condition, one that's likely to be noncancerous (benign).

Less common symptoms of retinoblastoma include

redness and eye irritation that doesn't go away
differences in iris color and pupil size
tearing
cataracts
bulging of the eyes.
