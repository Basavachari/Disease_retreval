Symptoms

Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome can include:

Burning, tingling or numbness of the fingers 
Difficulty gripping and hold tools, pens, eating utensils and other objects 
Problems making a strong fist

Symptoms may appear first at night and are most noticeable in the thumb and the index and middle fingers. People with carpal tunnel syndrome often describe awakening with a tingling sensation and the need to shake out the hands to recover normal feeling. There can be pain in the wrist that radiates into the hand or into the forearm. If the condition is not treated, the muscles of the thumb can waste away so that the normal mound of muscles at the base of the thumb eventually flattens.
