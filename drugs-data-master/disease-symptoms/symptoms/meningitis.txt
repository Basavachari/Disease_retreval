Symptoms

The symptoms of meningitis vary, but often include:

Headache


Fever


Stiff neck

Other symptoms may include:

Sensitivity to light


Nausea


Vomiting


Drowsiness


Confusion

Symptoms may be milder in cases of viral meningitis, while in cases of bacterial meningitis, symptoms may come on quite suddenly. In very young children, symptoms may be particularly hard to detect. Babies with meningitis may be less active, vomit, refuse to eat or be irritable. A person in later stages of bacterial meningitis may have seizures and lose consciousness (pass out).
