Symptoms

The way PTSD is defined has evolved over the last 20 years or more. As research evolves, so does the description of the illness.

In most cases, a diagnosis of PTSD requires that you have been exposed to a severe trauma. The trauma must have happened directly to you, you must have witnessed the event in person, or — if you were not present for the trauma, it occurred to someone very, very close to you. The trauma must have involved death, or serious physical injury, or the threat of serious injury or death.

At some later time, you may begin to have the following symptoms:

Experiencing intrusive mental images, thoughts or upsetting dreams related to the traumatic event 
Feeling as if the trauma is recurring 
Having marked anxiety and physical distress (shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, sweating) 
Avoiding all reminders (thoughts, people, conversations, activities) of the trauma 
Being unable to remember important details about the trauma 
Having markedly negative beliefs or expectations about oneself or others 
Persistently blaming oneself or others for the trauma 
Unrelenting negative emotion 
Losing interest in activities that were once enjoyable 
Feeling detached or disconnected from other people 
Feeling emotionally numb (unable to experience positive emotions, such as love) 
Believing that your life will be shorter than originally expected 
Being constantly on guard against danger and feeling easily startled 
Feeling stirred up (having trouble sleeping, being irritable, aggressive, reckless or self-destructive, lacking concentration) 
According to the definition, PTSD symptoms must last for at least one month and must seriously affect your ability to function normally at home, at work or in social situations.
