Symptoms

Symptoms of a TIA are the same as those of stroke. However, TIA symptoms usually last for less than one to two hours. Most TIAs actually last only five to 20 minutes.

Symptoms of a TIA can include:  
Dizziness or confusion  
Weakness or paralysis on one side of the body  
Sudden, severe numbness in any part of the body  
Visual disturbance, including sudden loss of vision  
Difficulty walking, including staggering or veering  
Coordination problems in the arms and hands  
Slurred speech or inability to speak
