Symptoms

Symptoms usually occur over many years. The person may be distressed and function poorly at work and at home. Medical evaluation does not explain the symptoms, or the symptoms may exceed what would be expected in any medical illness that is found. Pain is the most common symptom. Symptoms can appear in almost any part of the body.
