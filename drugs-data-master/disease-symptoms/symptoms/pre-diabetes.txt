Symptoms

Pre-diabetes is often called a "silent" condition because it usually has no symptoms. You can have pre-diabetes for several years without knowing it. Certain risk factors increase the chance that you have pre-diabetes. These risk factors include:

Being overweight 
Being 45 years or older 
A family history of diabetes 
Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol) 
High triglycerides 
High blood pressure 
A history of gestational diabetes 
Being African-American, American Indian, Asian-American, Pacific Islander or Hispanic American/Latino

If you have one or more of these risk factors, your doctor may recommend a blood sugar test. An abnormal result is likely to be the first sign that you have pre-diabetes.
