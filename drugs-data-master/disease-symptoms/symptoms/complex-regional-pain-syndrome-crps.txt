Symptoms

Symptoms of CRPS can include:

Intense pain, throbbing, burning and swelling, usually in the hand or foot

Shiny, thin skin around the affected area 


Initially increased but later diminished hair over the affected area 


Brittle, thickened nails 


Dry and withered skin 


Skin that feels warmer or cooler than usual 


Skin that changes color 


Increased sweating

The condition can progress through three stages. However, not everyone goes through every stage.

In the earliest stage, days to weeks after an injury, the limb can become dry, hot, red and painful. Even the lightest touch or the slightest movement can cause excruciating pain. At this point, CRPS can be mistaken for other conditions. Your doctor may not be able to confirm the diagnosis of CRPS at this stage.

Over the next few weeks to months, the skin can become shiny, thin and cool. The limb becomes mottled and purplish. There is considerable swelling. Pain worsens. The nails become brittle and can grow faster or slower than normal. As the limb becomes difficult to move, you may have more pain further up the limb. This might be related to muscle stiffness and soreness.

Some people experience other movement problems, including weakness, spasm and tremor. An affected limb can become permanently flexed or bent (contractures). In some people, the skin can become tight, dry and shriveled. The bones can become brittle because they aren't being used. The skin, muscles and joints stiffen so that the affected area cannot be moved. Some patients have less pain at this point. Once the disease reaches this point, it is extremely difficult to treat.
