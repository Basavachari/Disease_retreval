Symptoms

Symptoms of sickle cell anemia include:

Fatigue, shortness of breath, pale skin and fingernails due to anemia 
Recurrent bouts of pain in the abdomen, chest, back, arms or legs 
A yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes  
Slowed growth and delayed puberty in children 
Frequent infections 
Eye problems, including blindness 
Stroke

When sickled red cells block blood vessels, the oxygen supply to body cells is obstructed. This causes painful episodes called crises. Painful sickle cell crises can affect many different joints and organs. The back, chest, extremities and abdomen are affected most commonly. The level of pain varies, from trivial to excruciating. The episodes typically last from two to seven days.

In about half the cases, the pain crisis is accompanied by:

Fever 
Nausea
Vomiting 
High blood pressure 
Fast heart rate


These painful episodes can be triggered by many things. Triggers include:

Infection 
Stress 
Alcohol consumption 
Dehydration

Women are more likely to experience a painful episode during their menstrual period.

But the majority of sickle cell crises have no identifiable cause.
