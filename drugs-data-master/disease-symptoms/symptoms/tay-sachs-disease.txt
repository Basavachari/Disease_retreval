Symptoms

Early signs and symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease can include:

Loss of muscle tone  
Exaggerated response to sudden noises  
Lack of energy  
Loss of motor skills, such as the ability to roll over, crawl, reach for things or sit up

In its advanced form, the disease causes a gradual loss of vision, deafness, seizures, gradual paralysis and dementia. Red spots may appear on the retina (inside the eye).
