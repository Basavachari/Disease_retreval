Symptoms

Shin splints cause muscle pain and tenderness along the inner side of the lower shin. These symptoms tend to affect about 2 to 6 inches of muscle and tendon in the shin area. Pain usually continues after exercise ends, and you may even feel it when you are resting and not putting weight on the affected leg.
