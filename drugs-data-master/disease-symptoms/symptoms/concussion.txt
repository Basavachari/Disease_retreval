Symptoms

A concussion can cause any or all of the following symptoms:

Headache  
Neck pain  
Nausea or vomiting  
Dizziness or vertigo  
Hearing loss  
Blurred or double vision  
Changes in the ability to smell or taste  
Fatigue  
Irritability, anxiety or change in personality  
Loss of memory (amnesia)  
Confusion, difficulty concentrating or slowing of reaction time  
Brief loss of consciousness

Symptoms most often appear immediately after the injury. However, in some cases, a person will feel fine at first and have the symptoms minutes to hours later.

Symptoms such as coma (unresponsiveness), seizures or paralysis or weakness of an arm or leg suggest a more serious form of head injury.
