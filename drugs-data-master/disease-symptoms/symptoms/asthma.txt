Symptoms

Symptoms of asthma include:

Wheezing (a whistling sound as air is forcibly expelled) 
Difficulty breathing 
Chest tightness 
A persistent cough


For some people with asthma, a chronic cough is the main symptom.

Symptoms of a severe asthma attack can include:

Extreme shortness of breath 
Chest tightness 
A rapid pulse 
Sweating 
Flared nostrils and pursed lips 
A need to sit upright 
A bluish discoloration of the lips and fingernails

Between asthma attacks or flare-ups, people with mild or moderate asthma may not have any symptoms.

In some people, symptoms flare up only during or after exercise.

People with asthma tend to have more severe symptoms when they have an upper respiratory infection such as a cold or the flu.
