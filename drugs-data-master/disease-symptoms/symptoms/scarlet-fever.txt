Symptoms

Scarlet fever usually is triggered by a strep throat infection, which causes the following symptoms:

Fever and chills  
Headache  
A red and sore throat  
Enlarged tonsils  
Swollen lymph nodes ("swollen glands") in the neck

Within 12 to 48 hours after these symptoms appear, the typical scarlet fever rash begins.


The scarlet fever rash is as bright red as sunburn, and it often has a fine texture like sandpaper ("sandpaper rash") or gooseflesh (goosebumps). It usually starts in the underarm area, groin and neck, then spreads to the trunk, back, arms and legs. Other symptoms of scarlet fever include:

A pale area around the mouth  
White strawberry tongue—A white coating with red dots on the tongue's surface  
Red strawberry tongue or raspberry tongue that occurs when the white tongue coating peels and leaves a red coating with red dots  
Pastia's lines—A darkening or redness of the normal skin creases, especially in the crook of the arm

Occasionally, scarlet fever follows a streptococcal skin infection, such as an infection of burns or wounds, or impetigo. When this happens, the rash and related skin symptoms appear, but there are no symptoms related to strep throat.
