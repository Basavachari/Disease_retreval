Stage I (earliest signs of skin damage) — White people or people with pale skin develop a lasting patch of red skin that does not turn white when you press it with your finger. In people with darker skin, the patch may be red, purple or blue and may be more difficult to detect. The skin may be tender or itchy, and may feel warm or cold and firm.

Stage II — The injured skin blisters or develops an open sore or abrasion that does not extend through the full thickness of the skin. There may be a surrounding area of red or purple discoloration, mild swelling and some oozing.

Stage III — The ulcer becomes a crater and that goes below the skin surface.

Stage IV — The crater deepens and reaches into a muscle, bone, tendon or joint.
