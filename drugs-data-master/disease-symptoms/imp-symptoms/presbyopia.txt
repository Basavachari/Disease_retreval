Words appear blurred at a reading distance that used to be comfortable.

Reading material or other objects must be held farther away from your eyes to gain clarity or see details.

Brighter light is needed to see clearly (bright light constricts the pupils, which changes the focus of the light on the retina).

You have difficulty reading late at night, or when you are tired or stressed.

Your eyes become uncomfortable, or you become tired or drowsy when doing close work because of the strain of eye muscles working to change the lens shape.

You may have headaches as a result of muscle tension.
