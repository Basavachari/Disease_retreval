Incubation of the disease averages 12 to 14 days. During this stage, the newly infected person may feel fine or have very mild symptoms that mimic the early stages of a cold or flu and is not contagious.

Initial symptoms arise over the next two to four days and include fever (101 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), head and body aches, and generally feeling very sick. Although patients may be contagious at this stage, the person typically becomes contagious during the rash stages.

Early rash lasts about four days. Typically, a rash first appears as red spots in the mouth that turn to sores, and then spread to the mouth and throat. The sores then break open to spread the virus in the mouth and throat. At the same time, a rash appears on the skin of the face and spreads to the arms, hands, legs and feet. Within 24 hours, the rash spreads all over the body. By the third day, the rash changes into raised bumps, and, a day later, the bumps fill with a thick fluid. Often there is a depression in the middle of each bump.

Next, the rash enters the second stage, called pustular rash, in which the bumps become pustules, bumps that feel like a hard, round ball is inside the skin.

The pustules develop into scabs, and most bumps scab over within two weeks after the early rash appeared.

Finally, the scabs fall off, often leaving a pitted scar. Most scabs are gone by three weeks after the rash appears. Once all the scabs disappear, the person is no longer contagious. Unlike chickenpox, all smallpox bumps appear to go through the same stage at the same time.
