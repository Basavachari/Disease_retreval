Bright red blood on the toilet paper after having a bowel movement, especially if the stool was very hard or very large. Blood also may streak the surface of the stool, or color the water in the toilet bowl.

For a prolapsed hemorrhoid, a soft, grape-like mass protruding from the anus that may discharge mucous.

For external hemorrhoids, bothersome protrusions and difficulties keeping the anal area clean.

External hemorrhoids may also cause intermittent swelling, irritation, and mild discomfort, especially after a period of diarrhea or constipation.


Severe pain is not a typical symptom of hemorrhoids (except for thrombosis of an external hemorrhoid).
