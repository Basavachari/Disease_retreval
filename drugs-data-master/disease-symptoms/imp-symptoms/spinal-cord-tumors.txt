Pain. Back pain is usually the most prominent symptom, but pressure on the spinal cord can trigger pain that feels as if it is coming from various parts of the body. This pain is sometimes severe, is often constant and can have an aching or burning quality.

Sensory changes. These can take the form of numbness, tingling, decreased sensitivity to temperature or cold sensations.

Motor problems. Tumors that hinder nerve communication can cause muscle-related symptoms, such as progressive muscle weakness or loss of control over the bowel or bladder.
