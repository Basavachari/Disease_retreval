People with a low red blood cell count may feel weak, tired, or short of breath during regular activity.

People with too few platelets bruise and bleed easily.

People lacking in normal white blood cells are prone to infections and fevers because their immune systems are not working properly. (Infections can range in seriousness from frequent colds and cold sores to pneumonia.) However, some people with CLL may have high white blood cell counts because of the build-up of lymphocytes.
