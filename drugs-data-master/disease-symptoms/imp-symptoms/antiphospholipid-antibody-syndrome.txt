		Heart valve problems that can mimic bacterial endocarditisBlood clots in the upper chambers of the heartDeep vein thrombosis (blood clot in a vein) that can pain and swelling in a leg or arm; these clots can travel to the lungs (see below) and cause difficulty breathing or even death


Blood cells. Some people with a condition called immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) have antiphospholipid antibodies. The primary problem in ITP is low platelets, the blood cells that aid clot formation and prevent excessive bleeding. Over time, some people with ITP develop APS. People with ITP and APS can have problems with excessive clotting and excessive bleeding.

Chest pain
Shortness of breath
