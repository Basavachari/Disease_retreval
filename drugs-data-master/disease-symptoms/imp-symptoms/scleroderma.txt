Raynaud's phenomenon. In people with this condition, blood vessels in the fingers or toes, and sometimes in the tips of the nose and ears, suddenly constrict. The area turns white or blue and becomes cold and numb. This is followed by a flush of redness as the area warms up again, often together with pain or tingling. Raynaud's phenomenon can be triggered by exposure to cold or vibration or by emotional stress.

Skin symptoms. There can be swelling of the fingers, hands, forearms and face and sometimes the feet and lower legs. This is followed by a skin thickening and tightness that can limit body movement. There also can be:  
	Skin ulcers Skin that is lighter or darker than usual Loss of hair Abnormal skin dryness, including vaginal dryness Calcium deposits in the skin (subcutaneous calcinosis) Small red spots caused by localized swelling of tiny blood vessels (telangiectasias)

Joints. Joints can swell and become painful and stiff.

Muscles. Muscles can become weak, and tendons can become abnormally thick, causing pain and limited joint motion.

Digestive system. When scleroderma involves the esophagus, it can cause a feeling of fullness or burning pain (heartburn) in the upper abdomen or behind the breastbone, together with difficulty swallowing or keeping food down. Other digestive symptoms include bloating, constipation, lower abdominal pain or difficulty controlling bowel movements.

Lungs. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, especially when you exercise, and a dry cough that doesn't bring up sputum or mucus.

Heart. Problems can include chest pain, abnormal heart rhythms and heart failure.
