Hyperviscosity syndrome: Buildup of the IgM antibody can cause the blood to become abnormally thick (viscous) and have trouble circulating. This can result in headache, dizziness, confusion, and blurred vision. It can also cause stroke-like symptoms such as slurred speech. Hyperviscosity syndrome can be life-threatening.

Cryoglobulinemia: The IgM antibody makes the blood thick only at cooler temperatures. The patient's hands and feet may hurt in the cold.

Cold agglutinin disease: The IgM antibody causes red blood cells to be destroyed when temperatures are low. Circulation in a person's fingers, nose, ears, and toes may be affected.

Amyloidosis: The IgM antibody collects in one or more organs. This can damage the organ and hinder its function. A patient may experience weakness, trouble breathing, and swelling in the feet and legs.
