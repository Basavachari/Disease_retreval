Pneumonia caused by CMV can be life threatening.

CMV can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus, stomach, liver, gall bladder, pancreas and colon, causing ulcers, liver inflammation, intestinal obstruction and colitis. Symptoms can include painful and difficult swallowing, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, yellow skin and watery or bloody diarrhea.

CMV can infect the brain and other parts of the nervous system, causing symptoms like headache, confusion, and leg weakness.
